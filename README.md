# README

After cloning, first thing to do is rails db:migrate to set up the tables and database.
Then, do rails db:seed to seed the db with 2089 highlights.  I think that's the number.  Over 150,000 words!
rails server to get it up and running in localhost:3000
Find the main page at localhost:3000/hilight
Most of the styling is in application.html.erb.  Index.html.erb is where the main view sits.  Just splurts out a random highlight from the database.  You can see that it has the JSON rendering commented out, but ready to go if called upon.

Yea!
