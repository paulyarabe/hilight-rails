# README

After cloning, first thing to do is rails db:migrate to set up the tables and database.
Then, do rails db:seed to seed the db with 2089 highlights.  I think that's the number.  Over 150,000 words!
rails server to get it up and running in localhost:3000
Find the main page at localhost:3000/hilight
Most of the styling is in application.html.erb.  Index.html.erb is where the main view sits.  Just splurts out a random highlight from the database.  You can see that it has the JSON rendering commented out, but ready to go if called upon.

Keep getting more highlights by clicking the icon in the top left of the page.

Yep, that's about it!
