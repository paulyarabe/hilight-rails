So you want to get your hands on all the nuggets you can in short order. But undue speed can cause you to overlook evidence or misinterpret it. It can force mistakes. As the Roman senator Tacitus said, “Truth is confirmed by inspection and delay; falsehood by haste and uncertainty.” When you are always racing forward, it becomes hard to take a step back. But stepping back can be the key to a case. An investigator must maintain a near-impossible balance between patience and impatience. A burning drive to find the truth quickly is essential, but so is a calm resolve to take your time to get it right.\\n\\nSeptember 17, 2019", "My tenth day as U.S. Attorney was a Sunday. I was sitting in my office in jeans and a T-shirt, catching up on the voluminous weekly summary of criminal cases my unit chiefs put together regularly, when my deputy, Boyd Johnson, unexpectedly walked in with one of our fraud unit supervisors, John Hillebrecht. “John needs to talk to you,” he said. “We have a situation.”\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "Boyd, my first, was one of my oldest and dearest friends, whom I promoted from corruption chief to deputy U.S. Attorney on my first day in the new job. Tall, athletic, and likable, Boyd is a keenly intuitive lawyer and an energetic and inspiring leader. We had worked together twice before, in private practice and at SDNY. I trust him like a brother. He was now my guide these first few days and weeks in office. Quick practice point: try if you can to work with your best and smartest friends in life.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "As U.S. Attorney, I established an honor in his name—the McCabe Medal—to be awarded at the annual office dinner, along with two other decades-old awards, to recognize a law enforcement agent who best personified Kenny’s ethic and character. What was it that so distinguished Kenny McCabe? Why should he be not only honored but emulated? One reason is that Kenny believed in the virtue of work. He didn’t take shortcuts, toot his own horn, or blame others for failure. He believed that you just do your job and you do it well. Every day. Even when it’s hard. Even when it’s dull or even when no one is looking. Even when the work seems small and beneath your title or God-given talent. Kenny took his pictures, made his rounds, followed his leads. He turned over rocks day after day after day, building cases he knew would take years to make or might not ever get made. Kenny was a brick-by-brick guy.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "Ambitious people tend to think of every endeavor as a ball game in which they’re going to pitch a perfect game. It doesn’t work that way. People should want to be monumentally successful—and Kenny, it should be said, was a very ambitious cop—but you’ve got to do it one pitch at a time. Pitch after pitch after pitch. That’s what develops into a perfect game or, by analogy, an outstanding career. No one who ever pitched a perfect game in baseball went to the mound that day expecting to do so. Not only is that unrealistic; it is the height of arrogance. Yet people all the time make that very mistake. They want to be great, before they’ve learned how to be good. The Kenny McCabes of the world know different. What else? Kenny was an expert. His devotion to tracking and tormenting mobsters was complete, bordering on compulsive. He knew everything there was to know about the Italian Mafia in New York and New Jersey. He simply knew more than anyone else.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "Many ambitious people do not have patience, and so their ambition yields little in the way of substantive results.\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2019", "An innocent man was accused and forever injured because of a failure to sufficiently reconsider. It was not the first error that wrought the injustice. First errors seldom do. It wasn’t the second or third error either. Rather, it was the continuing and lazy persistence in the first blunder—the mismatch of similar fingerprints by mistake but not with malice—followed by discoveries concerning Mayfield’s wife, work, and religion quickly accepted as corroboration instead of coincidence that greased a slow-motion miscarriage of justice through a fog of latent bias and stereotype. As I said at the outset and as the Mayfield case teaches, reconsideration is difficult, while confirmation is easy. It is much more difficult to keep your mind open when someone else in the chain of command has put forth a credible conclusion, or when you have already decided a thing. Changing your mind is hard, especially if it means going against an expert or a higher-up. In federal trial practice, there is actually a legal motion called a “motion for reconsideration.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Courts almost never grant such motions, but it is a real motion that lawyers make. It’s a formal way of saying to the judge who screwed you, hey, I know we were just in your courtroom and we’ve been through all this, but respectfully we think you got it wrong and could you change your mind please? Good luck with that. Most lawyers understand that it’s a long-shot gambit, especially absent significant new facts or a change in the law. Some litigants don’t bother making the motion even if it has merit, because they fear irritating the judge still presiding over their case. It may be that most motions for reconsideration should be denied on the merits, but one wonders if the failure rate of such court pleas is influenced in part by the psychology of stubbornness.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "An investigator searching for truth and trying to assure just and fair accountability can never stop examining and reexamining conclusions about any aspect of the case. This is not to say that at each step of the way everyone involved in the case should be paralyzed by fear of making a mistake. But it does mean that even after someone seemingly smarter or more experienced than you has come to a conclusion, that conclusion should not necessarily stand forever. That’s true not only in the investigative stage but even after a charge has been brought. Even after an accusation has been filed, fair-minded people must continue to think about new evidence coming to light\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Judge Learned Hand once, while testifying before Congress, laid claim to a phrase, borrowed from Oliver Cromwell speaking in a wholly different context in 1650. Learned Hand said of that phrase, “I should like to have [it] written over the portals of every church, every school, and every courthouse, may I say, of every legislative body in the United States.” What principle did Learned Hand wish every pastor, teacher, judge, and representative to remember just when crossing the threshold of their places of work? It was this: “I beseech ye in the bowels of Christ, think that ye may be mistaken.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "John O’Malley is not a very talkative guy. But he did say this to Glisson: “I hate to use the word ‘luck’ with you because a guy who went to jail for seventeen years, maybe you don’t use that word ‘luck.’ But for your letter to find its way to my desk is like divine intervention. That’s how lucky you are. That letter goes to anyone else, they wouldn’t have known anything.” It would have been just another letter by just another convicted criminal who was proclaiming his innocence. Dime a dozen. When asked about O’Malley, Glisson later said, “I thank God every day for John O’Malley. When I looked in that man’s eyes, I saw a man who has integrity; I saw a man who was honest.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "In the world of criminal law, asking innumerable questions helps avoid embarrassment, errors, and miscarriages of justice. A case is more likely to be harmed by suppressed questions than by suppressed evidence. This is true in all important endeavors involving truth. Deep understanding of any subject or set of facts requires active inquiry. That in turn requires asking questions. Every kind of question—searching questions, uncomfortable questions, broad questions, narrow questions, long-shot questions, repetitive questions, hypothetical questions. Many questions should be asked twice, perhaps even a third time, and rephrased each time to make sure the question was really understood and to make sure you understood the answer. Smart questions are good; dumb questions are even better. There is no such thing as a dumb question, the saying goes, but the shorthand is useful here. So-called dumb questions are often foundational; they tend to get to the basics, to the bottom line.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Dumb questions uncover superficial reasoning, reveal bad logic, and expose fake experts. The world is populated, even in rarefied workplaces, with bullshit artists.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "I don’t know the right number of questions a person should ask in any particular context. But what I do know is this: find the person in the new job who asks the fewest questions, and there’s your problem. One veteran in my office gave this advice to newly minted supervisors: “People are going to come into your office and ask some crazy stuff. They’re not the ones you need to worry about. It’s the guy you haven’t seen in six weeks.”\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "In that moment of panic, his unmasking close at hand, Josh had a flash of genius. This is what he said, with a straight face, to the aspiring cooperating witness: “Listen, you may have to testify about all of this one day to a completely clueless jury. So you’re really going to have to break it down. So, as you explain the transactions today, I want you to pretend like I’m your nine-year-old nephew. Go slow and take it from the top.” Brilliant. It was a simple gambit but one that allowed Josh at once to save face, learn the case, and simplify the testimony. It gave him the space and excuse to ask questions to his heart’s delight—basic questions, ignorant questions, dumb questions, the kind anyone’s nine-year-old nephew might ask. He could be confused, and he could show his confusion. He could ask the witness to repeat himself, to say it again.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "It is an impossibility. In fact, I have come to believe that if you meet a leader who knows a super-impressive amount of minutiae and granular detail, that leader—with the possible exception of Steve Jobs—is likely failing at the job of leading, endlessly losing the forest for the trees that the subordinates should be tending to. Leaders need judgment more than knowledge, along with a reliable method of cross-examining those closer to the facts than they can ever be. A trustworthy method of inquiry, in the face of lesser knowledge—plus a good understanding of people—is how leaders make proper decisions.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Here’s what I think: if you are listening hard and if your dumb questions address the heart of the matter, it’s okay. They may betray ignorance, but also likely show the right focus. If you have a penchant for asking foundational questions that people think you should already know the answers to, so what? You are on the right track. Ignorance is quickly remedied. A tendency toward the tangential, the irrelevant, the collateral, is not so easily fixed. It is okay not to know things, so long as you want to know things, care to know things, and when those are the things you actually need to know. Curiosity and query are among the most important pillars of sound leadership.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "My favorite question to ask often yielded the worst possible answer I could get; the question was, why do we do it this way? This may be an ignorant and basic question, but an even more ignorant and shameful answer was this: “We’ve always done it that way.” That is literally the only answer to any question that would actually make me angry. One might think it strange that I would be offended at this justification of tradition in the conservative task of law enforcement, but that answer is a barrier to innovation, a barrier to efficiency, and a potential barrier to justice.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Asking questions as a junior person leads to deeper understanding. Asking questions as a leader does the same, plus it creates, one hopes, a climate of curiosity and self-reflection, for individuals and for the institution as a whole. And it fosters a culture of thoughtfulness, curiosity, critical thinking, understanding, and challenge, rather than rote acceptance of the status quo. Because that acceptance is how the mighty fall.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2019", "Sometimes innovation requires a step backward when technology makes us less rather than more effective. Innovation—whether in relation to how a company makes a product or how an agent investigates a case—means constantly reevaluating and reassessing technology and the capacity for human error or lack of imagination. It also means resisting shortcuts, laziness, and complacency.\\n\\nOctober 5, 2019", "Profit and justice are different. Justice often must suffer the loss of substantial investment because that is what justice itself demands. When a backbreaking investigation does not yield enough evidence of a crime, when it turns out that a miscreant has come up to the criminal line but not put a thieving toe over it, when everyone thinks the target probably did the deed but doubts linger, when the law in its idiocy or a court in its naïveté has exempted from prosecution bad conduct that reasonable people loathe and want to punish, there is only one choice: to walk away. Walking away can be deeply and viscerally unsatisfying. But if all the raised expectations and personal investments and sunk costs sweep people toward an unjust charging decision, that is a miscarriage.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "there is sometimes an internal source of pressure that is also dangerous and inexcusable. That occurs when leaders of an institution—even inadvertently—create pressure to produce a particular result. They do this by forgetting, as I sometimes did, to make clear that they are prepared to accept that there may be no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and that this is okay. Because profit and justice are different.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "But even good-faith questions about the progress of an investigation, if asked with sufficient intensity (and frequency), can build a subtle pressure toward a particular outcome. Such a dynamic can convey that the leadership will be disappointed with anything less than a criminal charge whether the case is weak or not, whether the case is just or not. That kind of pressure, if not defused, can undermine both fair process and a just result. Leaders can’t be blind to that.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "One evening, I heard secondhand from Rich Zabel that one of the corruption prosecutors had said, “I’m worried Preet will be pissed if we can’t make the case.” That was a full-stop moment. It might have been a passing remark, but to Rich (and to me) it was a wake-up call, because we realized that our well-meaning but endless badgering might be creating a pressure cooker. Now I became less concerned about the cases than about the morale and psyche of the teams. Passing remark or not, I was deeply bothered that at least one AUSA might have been worried about disappointing me rather than exclusively focused on finding the truth and making the fairest recommendation, whatever that might be. Rich and I decided to clear the air.\\n\\nNovember 29, 2019", "“I want to make sure that everyone understands something. I’m really proud of all of you. I hired most of you, and I did that because I trust you and I respect your judgment. We only stand for one thing in this place, and that is to do the right thing. And I ask a lot of questions about these cases because I care about them, because we can’t get it wrong, and because whatever we do will have consequences for the state of New York. And on people’s faith in government. And on the reputation of this office. But I want to make something very clear: I want you to be aggressive, thorough, and complete. And if on either case you guys tell me there’s not a proper charge to bring, I’m going to be just as proud of you and just as proud of this office as I would be if you recommended bringing charges. So I don’t want you to ever think that I or Rich or Joon or Dan is looking for a particular result. That’s not what we do here. That’s not what I want you to do. I’m sure you know that. I hope you know that. But I wanted to have this meeting to remove any doubt. We have the luxury in this office of being able to spend time, energy, and effort aggressively pursuing investigations of the most powerful people in the state and in the country because we think no one’s above the law. But as one of my predecessors used to say, ‘You judge an office not just by the cases it brings but also by the cases it doesn’t bring.’ And if it’s not right to bring a case, we won’t bring it.” I closed by saying, “I don’t want you to worry about this or me for one second.”\\n\\nNovember 29, 201", "Regulators and the regulations they promulgate are not perfect. But we hear at conferences and in training materials everywhere the constant refrain: do X because that is what regulators expect; do Y because regulators will more likely be persuaded that you discharged your duty. It’s like teaching to the test. You’re forgetting about the core value of education. When you teach to the test, you’re not explaining to students that what’s important is the value of education and curiosity and wisdom; you’re teaching them they’ve just got to get some answers right to get a good grade. That, to me, is failure.\\n\\nNovember 30, 2019", "I once met a hedge fund general counsel and asked what he did to welcome people who came into the firm. He said very proudly that he met with every person who started and had a personal session with them so that they would be familiar with him and be comfortable coming to him. He said he takes them through a lot of the regulations and requirements, and he takes them through recent changes in securities laws. That’s terrific. But I wondered, how did he begin the talk? Did he begin the talk with a simple and strongly delivered message? Here’s what you need to understand about this place: We don’t cheat and we don’t steal and we don’t lie. If you do, you’re out, simple as that. We have zero tolerance for any of that nonsense. That message, I submit, will sit a lot longer than the ocean of minutiae that will follow. And yet I don’t know how often simple messages like that are delivered.\\n\\nNovember 30, 2019", "Culture is defining. Not just for business organizations, but for all institutions. Culture shapes universities, medical practices, movie studios, prosecutors’ offices, and sports franchises. White Houses too. Some cultures are healthy, some are merely ill, and others are on their deathbeds. In all cases, it takes leadership from the top to fix ailing cultures. Too many leaders are loath to tackle the problem. Some people don’t like going to the doctor, but sometimes only the doctor can put you on a path to wellness. That is true for the health of actual people, but it is also true for the long-term health of institutions. I have found, over time, that there is never any redundancy in repeating and reinforcing the need for, and importance of, integrity in any enterprise. Simple things, in fact, bear repeating. Whether one runs a U.S. Attorney’s Office or a giant corporation or an investment bank or a university, everyone—from the mail room to the boardroom—needs to understand and feel in their bones that the institution and its leaders care about integrity. That is the best way to protect against all manner of accusations, criminal or otherwise.\\n\\nNovember 30, 2019", "The key is to learn which criticism to take to heart to make yourself better and which criticism to laugh off; which criticism is well placed and which is foolish. The point is not to be dismissive about criticism but to be discerning about it.\\n\\nDecember 2, 2019", "In the preface to his book The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, the famed neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks announced that he was “equally interested in diseases and people.” He describes the limitations of the tool Hippocrates gave to medicine: the case history. Case histories describe, clinically, the course of a disease. Sacks says that is all well and good but deficient, because “they tell us nothing about the individual and his history; they convey nothing of the person, and the experience of the person, as he faces, and struggles to survive, his disease.” The illness, Sacks implores, must not be disembodied from the actual and unique person in whom the illness has taken up residence\\n\\nDecember 2, 2019", "There is no “subject” in a narrow case history; modern case histories allude to the subject in a cursory phrase (“a trisomic albino female of 21”), which could as well apply to a rat as a human being. To restore the human subject at the centre—the suffering, afflicted, fighting, human subject—we must deepen a case history to a narrative or tale; only then do we have a “who” as well as a “what,” a real person, a patient, in relation to disease—in relation to the physical.\\n\\nDecember 2, 2019", "trial judges—almost uniquely—don’t get. It is the vital education gained by watching other people do the same job. Trial lawyers watch other trial lawyers in court. They see what works, what doesn’t. They may copy tone or timing or tactics. When I was U.S. Attorney, I urged young prosecutors to watch their colleagues perform, as often as they could. Also to watch the best defense lawyers. Of course you learn by doing. But you also learn (and improve) by watching. This principle is not limited to lawyering. Athletes study other athletes, both during competitions and in highlight reels. Boxers watch other boxers; quarterbacks and pitchers and golfers do the same. And they up their own game by observing the best. The same for business leaders and journalists and actors. Trial judges are a little bit different.\\n\\nDecember 2, 2019", "One day that week, Dalya brought up the mail. In the pile was the most affecting note I received during the entire ordeal. It was handwritten on personal stationery. It was warm and kind. It was from Judge Fox. No other judge—and I knew many—sent such a personal and heartfelt note. I carried it in my briefcase for a long time. As a reminder of something. As a reminder of a small kindness of course. But also, I think, as one of many reminders over a lifetime that everyone is a human being, judges included.\\n\\nDecember 3, 2019", "All successful prosecutors tell compelling stories; it’s what convincing persuaders do. You can have facts and figures and statistics, but they are powerless and unpersuasive if not woven into a compelling narrative, an understandable story. Good prosecutors know not to present their cases as checklists. Trials are not box-checking exercises.\\n\\nDecember 3, 2019", "intent and motive are distinct concepts. Intent is that you meant to do the thing—pull the trigger, kill your victim—that it wasn’t an accident or a mistake; motive is why you did it. Why someone robbed a bank or killed a person or cooked the books is most often legally irrelevant to guilt. But it is deeply relevant to the jury who must decide guilt. Without addressing motive, the story is incomplete, and incomplete stories are less compelling. That’s why prosecutors talk about greed and power and jealousy and revenge, not because the statute demands it, but because jurors need to understand the case, not just in their brains, but in their guts, so they can carry out the terrifying duty of rendering a verdict. That’s also why good prosecutors use anecdotes and analogies and, occasionally, metaphors. And, throughout, simple language.\\n\\nDecember 3, 2019", "At trial, the trick for the prosecution is figuring out how—consistent with the constraints—to best get your point across. At the inquiry and accusation phases, you are mostly proving the case to yourself, hopefully after a rigorous, open-minded, unbiased internal review. Presumably you have convinced yourself beyond doubt of the defendant’s guilt. You are persuaded you have the right person, the right charges, the right evidence. But now all that remains is the small matter of proving guilt to other people. They are your jurors. You also, of course, need to persuade the judge you have a case. This requires putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. And it requires anticipating other people’s arguments. The strength of the evidence, the excellence of the investigation, the persuasiveness of the pretrial motions, all shape the outcome as well, but how the case is presented in the courtroom matters a great deal, especially in cases that are close or complicated by emotional issues.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2019", "You must look at the world from her perspective, her belief system, her biases and interests and goals. Understand her point of view, her assumptions, as well as or better than you know your own. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, who served as an AUSA in SDNY once upon a time, reminiscing about the U.S. Attorney he served, Henry Stimson, recalled that Stimson “very early instilled in me that you must prepare the other fellow’s case at least as well as he prepares it, usually better, so that there are no surprises, no nothing.”\\n\\nDecember 5, 2019", "trial lawyers, perhaps more than any other professionals, must understand what is going on in the heads and hearts of other people. You can’t put your head in the sand, can’t use sophistry, faulty logic, insults, taunts, non sequiturs. You are forced to worry about your credibility with people who are not already on your team—like the judge and the jury. That sounds basic and obvious, doesn’t it? But consider how radically different this is from much of modern social interaction, especially with respect to debates of the day. In regular life, you can shut out opposing views. You can swim in your own controversy-free lane at all times. You can avoid people with different views, different backgrounds, different experiences. You don’t have to hear them, read them, see them, engage them. You can always just change the channel. I think too many people take advantage of their right to cloister, to live in their little echo chambers, to settle into small societies of like-minded souls, never taking the time to test and strengthen the rightness of their beliefs through searching inquiry, vigorous debate, and open dialogue.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2019", "Now, in order to meet arguments, you have to consider flaws in your own arguments, which means you sometimes have to concede things. Oh, the thrill of a concession. When was the last time you saw a politician or a TV debater concede a point, refine an argument on the fly in the face of a well-articulated objection? What is the key to the courtroom? Preparation, command, eloquence, sure. Those all matter. But the key to the courtroom is credibility. Credibility is what makes your story believable. Concessions are a sign of strength, not weakness, because they enhance your credibility. It’s always better to volunteer a weakness than to have your adversary point it out. I would always advise this: If you have an incriminating conversation but no tape, say so. If there are discrepancies in the testimony of your witnesses, say so. If your cooperator is likely to come off like a jerk, say so.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2019", "I have often said this to young lawyers: Much of the time, your most important job as a lawyer is not to talk; it is to listen. You want to be a good lawyer? Work on how you speak. You want to be a great lawyer? Work on how you listen. You could substitute “leader” for “lawyer” in both of those sentences and express an even more universal truth. You know what is the most important advice we gave for conducting an effective direct examination? Listen to your witness. For cross-examination? Listen to your witness.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2019", "And at every phase of the trial, members of the jury are admonished repeatedly—to do what? To keep an open mind. Every day the judge reminds the jury to keep an open mind, to remember the presumption of innocence—until all sides have been heard, until all facts have been offered, until all fair arguments have been made.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2019", "If you announce your decision before any deliberation, if you close your eyes and ears to all debate, if you physically remove yourself from the discussion, then you are not worthy of being a decision maker in the case. Your view won’t be counted, and you will be sent home. This is the way our law has determined to best discover truth and achieve justice. There is something special in that; you wonder whether it provides some guidance for the way to search for truth and justice in our society as well. If society operated that way—with respectful and open-minded debate and full engagement—we can wonder whether we would have better laws and better policies instead of just bad blood.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2019", "justice must not only be done; it must be seen to be done. The public cares that there’s a cop on the beat, that people will be held accountable for egregious crimes, and that the entire process is done openly and transparently.\\n\\nDecember 6, 2019", "I stayed always within the four corners of the public charging documents, didn’t gild the lily. Was I sometimes sharp-edged and glib and sarcastic? Probably yes. It is perhaps preferable to be quieter. I can see the argument for that. It depends a bit on how one sees the job and its potential impact. Is it purely to prosecute or also to prevent? Also to educate? Also to warn? Also to deter? The important thing was not to affect any particular defendant’s right to a fair trial. Which I made sure I never did.\\n\\nDecember 6, 2019", "Now, I knew full well that nothing I said would affect Silver’s right to a fair trial; that event was far off, and voir dire assures that any potential juror who might have been affected would be struck. Still, I might have thought better of the timing of my rant. I might have stuck to my preplanned speech rather than inflame passions the day after the bombshell charges. I might have shown a little less exuberance. Reading these lines now, more than three years later, I can see how it sounds like something bordering on a political speech, a call to arms. That was not my intention. I was speaking out of earnest frustration about the political cesspool, and I was channeling the frustration of every New Yorker. But are prosecutors allowed to be frustrated, allowed to vent their frustration? Something about the speech felt satisfying, felt good. That should have been the warning sign: if it feels good, it’s probably a bad idea.\\n\\nDecember 7, 2019", "I have long marveled that anyone gets convicted of anything—given the stakes, the standard of proof, and the requirement of unanimity.\\n\\nDecember 7, 2019", "The prosecutors, for their part, wear intentional poker faces. The first time I sat in the well waiting for the foreperson to announce the verdict, my trial partner leaned in and whispered forcefully into my ear, “Remember, no emotion. No reaction. No matter what.” Acquittal or conviction, the poker face is a must. This is a matter of etiquette and also, I think, a conspicuous show of respect and humility.\\n\\nDecember 7, 2019", "On the eve of the 2016 U.S. presidential sweepstakes, famed chess champion, human rights activist, and self-exiled Russian Garry Kasparov posted this on social media: “That nervous feeling you have about tomorrow, Americans? That’s democracy working. Unpredictable elections, what a luxury!” After Trump won the presidency the next day, against all odds, Kasparov later offered this optimistic observation: “Trump’s election is greatest proof of democracy. You don’t know the results in advance!” The same should be said about verdicts in criminal cases. That nervous feeling you have when the jury comes out, prosecutors? That is justice working. Unpredictable verdicts, what a luxury.\\n\\nDecember 7, 2019", "Well into my tenure, our work on Rikers drove me to think about conditions of confinement, made me believe there is a moral reason to care about the state of correctional institutions. We should always care what a just and fair society should look like. In a just and fair society, the healthy should care about the sick; the rich should care about the poor; the mighty should care about the weak; and the prosecutor should care about the prisoner.\\n\\nDecember 8, 2019", "Milgram conducted a series of 1960s-era experiments testing the boundaries of human obedience to commands to hurt other people. Milgram himself was astonished that ordinary people would, under the mundane conditions of an academic experiment, blithely subject other human beings to tremendous pain by personally administering what they believed were high-voltage shocks. Why? Because a man in a lab coat told them to. Professor Milgram wrote this five decades ago: “This is, perhaps, the most fundamental lesson of our study: ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process.”\\n\\nDecember 8, 2019", "The law is an amazing tool, but it has limits. Good people, on the other hand, don’t have limits. The law is not in the business of forgiveness or redemption. The law cannot compel us to love each other or respect each other. It cannot cancel hate or conquer evil; teach grace or extinguish passions. The law cannot achieve these things, not by itself. It takes people—brave and strong and extraordinary people.\\n\\nDecember 8, 201"]
