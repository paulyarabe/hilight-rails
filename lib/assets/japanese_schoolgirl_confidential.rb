book_notes = ["A couple of weeks before TGC, Shinji Takenaga, the president of Shibuya-based market research firm ING, sits in the company’s meeting room. He’s wearing a red Tommy Hilfiger polo shirt and designer jeans that belie his forty years of age. Takenaga’s relaxed manner of speech and chilled attitude suit his youthful working environment—the next room is filled with schoolgirls. “Schoolgirls are the hardest market,” he says. “Because they’re the hardest to predict. Nobody knows what they’re going to do next.” If anyone would know that nobody knows what schoolgirls are going to do next, it’s Takenaga, whose firm specializes in their trends and tastes. “If Japanese companies would just listen to these schoolgirls, and deliver what they say they want,” says Takenaga, “they might not get a surefire hit, because there are no sure-fire hits. But they wouldn’t get a flop.”\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "November 7, 2014", "This is the philosophy behind Takenaga’s company, which has about 1,500 schoolgirls between the ages of fifteen and eighteen registered in Tokyo alone. ING also has branches in Nagoya and Osaka. “If girls have a part-time job at McDonalds or a convenience store, they have to work regular shifts,” Takenaga says. “At ING, we don’t have regular shifts—we simply tell girls when there’s a focus group or other event.\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "They have the freedom to work whenever they want, and to decide what it is they want to do. Another major difference from regular part-time work is that here their opinion means something.” In fact, companies pay good money to hear what they have to say. ING’s clients are both foreign and domestic, and include cosmetics, music, mobile phone, and internet companies who all want to know what makes these girls tick. They have good reason to. When schoolgirls buy something in Japan, they buy it in a big way.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "To test if something is cool on the street and in school, ING enlists girls in buzz campaigns, giving them free samples to pass out to their friends and to get feedback. “Some have the assumption that if we just give the girls samples it will create a buzz,” says Takenaga. “But it doesn’t work like that.” The girls are arbiters of taste, and if they dig a particular product, then they will tell their friends, and their friends will tell their friends, and a whole daisy chain is created.\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "Yonehara —or Yone as he prefers to be called—was not always a photographer. He was once an editor at egg magazine, the most influential girls’ magazine of the 1990s, and the kogal bible.\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "Despite being in a men’s magazine, Yone’s pages in egg became so popular among the girls appearing in them that ultimately the magazine made the switch to a periodical for girls in late 1996. Circulation spiked and issues like March 1997’s “high school girl photographer” special followed, featuring page upon page of Polaroids and snapshots of girls at school, asleep at their desks, and making funny faces with friends. Yone would ask schoolgirls if they wanted to be in the magazine, hand one of them a camera and tell them to take pictures of each other. This wasn’t a fantasy, it was real. The new formula was a hit, and later that spring, egg went from a struggling bi-monthly rag to a monthly must-read among high school girls. Egg became a tome of the times.\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "Much of egg ’s appeal was the rampant reader participation. In an age before the internet, egg offered internet-esque interaction: the reader generated content was what made it so special. Schoolgirls could send along opinionated essays, sticker pictures, or Polaroids covered in colorful graffiti. The pages of the magazine became so personalized by the kogal readers that it became a forum in glossy print that girls could roll up and shove in their school bag.\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "Yone pounded the pavement, searching the streets in and around Shibuya for the coolest girls and the latest trends. He’d talk to shop clerks, guys passing out flyers, and kids hanging out, to find out which parties the cute girls were going to. And then he’d go to those parties. “I really had to study the street—and then keep studying it,\\n\\nNovember 7, 2014", "Kogals were not only defining a new type of fashion, but were changing the way magazines covered fashion. “Before kogals, Japanese fashion was mostly top down,” says Yone. “People were told what was popular each season, this design or this color. But with kogals, it was about what kids were wearing on the streets. That’s how we knew what was popular.”\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "Egg magazine became known for the snapshots that showed girls’ fashion in the real world. The “street snap” style (as it’s called in Japan) spread to other magazines, both men’s and women’s. “ Egg ,” says Yone, “is one of the reasons why street snaps are so prevalent in Japanese magazines today.”\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "One of the girls spotted on the streets was Mami Nakamura, then a fifteen-year-old high school girl and now heading up the Shibuya clothing line BE RADIANCE.\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "Nakamura appeared in a few egg street snaps and was able to parlay that into regular modeling gigs and magazine covers of both egg and Popteen , a charisma clerk job at Shibuya 109, and even TV appearances. “I knew that being on the cutting edge of fashion was more than simply appearing on a magazine cover,” says Nakamura. “It meant that if I wore something, the trend would spread.” Presumptuous, but true. Like many celebrities, Nakamura was getting free clothes and cosmetics from companies hoping to spike sales and start a new trend. “Japanese people find comfort in being the same,” says Nakamura, “but I think there was a strong desire among us to be different, with our own way of thinking.”\\n\\nJune 27, 2020", "Since the magazines focused on the minutia of the models’ daily life, schoolgirls felt closer to them than celebrities on TV.” It was easy for schoolgirls to relate to articles on the contents of a model’s purse, or how she decorated her room, or an interview with her boyfriend about her character.\\n\\nNovember 7, 201"]
