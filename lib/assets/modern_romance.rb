Bigger than work, friends, and school combined.\\n\\nNovember 27, 2015", "November 28, 2015", "As she scrolled and scrolled through message after message, the guys in the audience looked on in horror. They couldn’t believe the sheer volume of it all. The woman said she felt bad that a lot of the messages would probably just be deleted because she would never have time to respond to them all. The men in the audience collectively let out a pained groan. Throughout all our interviews, this was a consistent finding: In online dating women get a ton more attention than men.\\n\\nNovember 28, 2015", "the images that resulted in the most conversation showed people doing interesting things. Sometimes faces didn’t even need to appear. A guy giving a thumbs-up while scuba diving. A woman standing in a barren desert. A woman playing a guitar. These photos revealed something deeper about their interests or their lives and led to more meaningful interaction\\n\\nNovember 28, 2015", "November 28, 2015", "November 28, 2015", "Near the end of 2014, Tinder claimed that the average user logged on eleven times per day and spent approximately seven minutes on each session, meaning they are there for more than 1.25 hours each day. That’s an amazing amount of time to do anything, let alone move your fingers around a tiny screen.\\n\\nNovember 28, 2015", "December 13, 2015", "At certain times, though, this “I need the best” mentality can be debilitating. I wish I could just eat somewhere that looks good and be happy with my choice. But I can’t. The problem is that I know somewhere there is a perfect meal for me and I have to do however much research I can to find it. That’s the thing about the Internet: It doesn’t simply help us find the best thing out there; it has helped to produce the idea that there is a best thing and, if we search hard enough, we can find it. And in turn there are a whole bunch of inferior things that we’d be foolish to choose.\\n\\nDecember 13, 2015", "If this mentality has so pervaded our decision making, then it stands to reason that it is also affecting our search for a romantic partner, especially if it’s going to be long-term. In a sense, it already has. Remember: We are no longer the generation of the “good enough” marriage. We are now looking for our soul mates. And even after we find our soul mates, if we start feeling unhappy, we get divorced\\n\\nBe careful of soul mate job. Not necessary\\n\\nDecember 13, 2015", "Schwartz’s research, and a considerable amount of scholarship from other social scientists too, shows that when we have more options, we are actually less satisfied and sometimes even have a harder time making a choice at all.\\n\\nDecember 13, 2015", "December 13, 2015", "On average, the maximizers put much more time and effort into their job search. They did more research, asked more friends for advice, and went on more interviews. In return, the maximizers in the study got better jobs. They received, on average, a 20 percent higher starting salary than the satisficers. After they started their jobs, though, Schwartz and his colleagues asked the participants how satisfied they were. What they found was amazing. Even though the maximizers had better jobs than the satisficers, by every psychological measure they felt worse about them. Overall, maximizers had less job satisfaction and were less certain they’d selected the right job at all. The satisficers, by contrast, were generally more positive about their jobs, the search process, and their lives in general. The satisficers had jobs that paid less money, but they somehow felt better about them.\\n\\nDecember 13, 2015", "many young people are showing a lack of interest in romance, and also, again, I love ramen\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "December 14, 2015", "The number of men and women between eighteen and thirty-four who are not involved in any romantic relationship with the opposite sex has risen since 1987, from 49 percent to 61 percent for men and from 39 percent to 49 percent for women\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "A whopping one third of Japanese people under thirty have never dated, 4 and in a survey of those between thirty-five and thirty-nine, more than a quarter reported that they’d never had sex. 5 (Okay, that was the last “whopping” I’ll use.\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Almost half of Japanese men and one third of women in their early thirties were still single as of 2005. 6\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Japan’s birthrate ranks 222nd out of 224 countries. A report compiled with the government’s cooperation two years ago warned that by 2060 the number of Japanese will have fallen from 127 million to about 87 million, of whom almost 40 percent will be sixty-five or older.\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe allocated $25 million in the 2014 fiscal budget for programs designed to get people to pair off and have babies, including government-funded dating services. An official survey conducted in 2010 showed that 66 percent of all prefecture governments and 33 percent of city/ward/town/village governments were implementing some form of marriage support. Even more do so today. 10\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Saga Prefecture has set up a Department of Connection that fixes up singles who want to meet new people, and both Shizuoka and Akita prefectures now provide internet communication services for singles, whom they inform about varous parties and events...some of which are supported by the government.\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Finally, Fukui Prefecture recently launched an online dating site called the Fukui Marriage-Hunting Café, and couples who meet on the site and marry receive cash and gifts.\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Surveys suggest that about 60 percent of male singles in their twenties and thirties in Japan identify themselves as herbivores. 13 In the first group we held, one of the first to arrive was Akira. A good-looking young Japanese dude in a really sharp suit, Akira, thirty, looked like he was probably doing well for himself. He seemed like a successful, confident young man. This guy wasn’t an herbivore, right? We did interviews and focus groups with singles on four continents, and in most of them we broke the ice by asking people to tell us how many people they’d asked out or flirted with on their smartphones in the past few weeks. When we asked Akira that question, he just shrugged. Pretty much all\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "It’s charai [kinda sleazy, in a playboy way] to try to pick up a woman you don’t know. But also, if a girl said yes to me, I wouldn’t want to go out with her. I don’t like girls who would want to be with a guy openly like that. Looking, smiling, winking. I want a girl who’s seiso [pure].”\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "But it has to be someone with the right background, with the right family. If it was someone I just met somewhere, I’d be too embarrassed to tell my parents. They’d be disappointed.”\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "I asked the women about the herbivore men and whether they wished guys would take more initiative. It was a resounding yes. These women yearned for the men in Japan to step up and just ask them out. From their perspective, the men’s extreme need for assurance and comfort from the women was irritating\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "men’s confidence and sense of self is tied to their professional success. Everyone we talked to in Tokyo seemed to recall the booming eighties as a different era for romance, with salarymen, flush with cash, who could confidently approach a pretty woman and ask for her number without fear. This too is probably an exaggeration, but a telling one. With career jobs now gone, it’s not only harder for men to meet a partner but also harder for them to support her financially. So it makes sense that insecurity might leave men feeling more scared of rejection.\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Nearly 50 percent of the single guys in Japan don’t even have friends of the opposite sex. 14\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Dating online requires self-promotion. A dating profile is a kind of advertisement, a way of marketing yourself to prospective partners. But this attitude doesn’t really fit well with Japanese culture.\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "Al, a young expat originally from Baltimore, tried to explain the motivations. “It’s like, I’m lonely, I’m scared of people ,” he said. “ I need to vent or just have a drink with someone who will listen to me and not judge me . They’re paying for the security. They’re paying not to be rejected.”\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "As I hit thirty, I started to despise the bar scene. I had experienced every single version of those nights. I knew all the possible outcomes, and I knew the probabilities of those outcomes. When you hit that point, you realize how fruitless trying to find love by barhopping can be; you have enough data to know that statistically the smartest thing for you to do when you walk into a bar is go to the bathroom, jerk off, and leave.\\n\\nDecember 14, 2015", "some of the greatest joys of life come from nurturing and from what’s called “generativity.” People have strong strivings to build something, to do something, to leave something behind. And of course having children is one way of doing that. My own experience having children was that I discovered there were rooms in my heart that I didn’t even know were there. And if I had committed to a life of repeated sexual flings, I never would have opened those doors.\\n\\nDecember 16, 201"]
