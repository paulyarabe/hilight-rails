And I think that’s a deadly combination in entrepreneurship.” —KEVIN SYSTROM, INSTAGRAM COFOUNDER\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "Systrom was pleased to be recruited by Zuckerberg, who he thought was hyperintelligent. He did not consider himself a stellar programmer. At Stanford, he felt like a regular person among prodigies from around the world, and barely scraped up a B in his first and only computer science course. Still, he fit the general category of what Zuckerberg needed. He did like photography, and one of his side projects was a website called Photobox, which allowed people to upload large image files and then share or print them, especially after parties at his fraternity, Sigma Nu. Photobox was enough to interest Zuckerberg, who wasn’t exactly picky at this point. Recruiting is always the hardest part of building a startup, and TheFacebook.com was growing so fast that he needed bodies in the room. Earlier that year, Zuckerberg was spotted in front of Stanford’s computer science building holding up a poster about his company, hoping to nab coders the way campus clubs recruited members. He had nailed the pitch, explaining to Systrom that he was offering a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be on the ground floor of something that would be truly huge.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "A few days later, Systrom went on a walk in the foothills near campus with the assigned mentor from his entrepreneurship program—a 1978 Stanford MBA in venture investing named Fern Mandelbaum. She worried Systrom would waste his potential if he gave everything up for somebody else’s vision. “Don’t do this Facebook thing,” she said. “It’s a fad. It won’t go anywhere.” Systrom thought she was right. Either way, he hadn’t come to Silicon Valley to get rich quick from a startup. He intended to get a world-class education and graduate from Stanford. He thanked Zuckerberg for his time, then planned for a different kind of adventure: studying abroad in Florence, Italy. They would keep in touch.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "Most people never get the chance to join an iconic company in its early days. Systrom squandered both of his, choosing instead to do something much less risky. For him, after graduating Stanford with degrees in management and engineering, going to Google was basically like going to grad school. He’d have a salary with a base of about $60,000—paltry compared to the life-changing wealth Facebook would have afforded—but he would get a crash course in Silicon Valley logic.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "By age 25 Systrom had received an introduction to how growth-driven Facebook was, how scrappy Twitter was, and how procedural and academic Google was. He was able to know their leaders and understand what drove them, which stripped them of their mystery. From the outside, Silicon Valley looked like it was run by geniuses. From the inside, it was clear that everyone was vulnerable, like he was, just figuring it out as they went along. Systrom wasn’t a nerd, or a hacker, or a quant. But he was perhaps no less qualified to be an entrepreneur. Still too risk-averse to start something without a salary, he took a job as a product manager at a tiny startup called Nextstop that made a website for people to share their travel tips. Meanwhile, on nights and weekends in cafes, he tried to build a new skill: making mobile apps.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "Systrom thought that what he lacked in technical ability—he didn’t actually know how to make an app, only a mobile website—he could make up for with his relative well-roundedness, which he hoped would help him come up with ideas that were more fun and interesting for regular people. He was learning to develop just through practicing, the same way he’d learned to DJ, or to make a leaf pattern in latte foam, or to become a better photographer. He made a handful of random tools, like a service called Dishd for people to rate meals instead of restaurants.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "From there, the two of them met every couple weeks at the Grove on Chestnut Street, ordering cappuccinos and talking about Burbn’s potential. Systrom’s program had just a few dozen people using it—his friends and their friends. He said he needed about $50,000 to get started making it a real company. Anderson was interested in the opportunity, but on one condition. “The biggest risk for you is you’re a sole founder,” Anderson told Systrom. “I usually don’t invest in sole founders.” He argued that without someone else at the top, nobody would tell Systrom when he was wrong, or push his ideas to be better. Systrom said he agreed, and would carve out a 10 percent equity in the term sheet for an eventual cofounder. Just like that, the company that would become Instagram got its start.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "Nobody had ever thought to ask Dorsey to put his money in a startup. If he did the Burbn deal, it would be his first “angel investment,” which is what a small, early startup investment from a rich person was termed in the Valley. It would be a cool thing to do with his newfound wealth from Twitter, while supporting Systrom, who he thought had exceedingly good taste. Systrom would figure out Burbn, whatever it became. Dorsey lent his support, to the tune of $25,000. His cheerleading would turn out to be far more valuable than that.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "The founders took over a whiteboard in one of the Dogpatch Labs conference rooms and had a brainstorming session that would serve as the foundation for their entire leadership philosophy: to ask first what problem they were solving, and then to try and solve it in the simplest way possible.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "Instead of continuing to build the app they’d originally promised investors, the cofounders stopped and tried a bigger idea. They aimed to do just one thing—photography—really well. In that sense, their story is similar to Odeo’s, when Dorsey and Williams switched gears to focus on Twitter. Instead of trying to get everyone to use their app, they invited only people they thought would be likely to spread the word to their followers elsewhere, especially designers and creatives. They sold exclusivity to investors, even when so many of them were skeptical. In that sense, they were like a luxury brand, manufacturing coolness and tastefulness around what they’d built.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "pretending things were going more smoothly than they actually were was part of the job of being a startup CEO. Everyone needed to think you were on the right track. His posturing was perhaps analogous to the modern pressure Instagram would introduce—the pressure to post only the best photos, making life seem more perfect than it actually was.\\n\\nSeptember 28, 2020", "Investor Steve Anderson reminded Systrom and Krieger of their strongest asset. “Anybody can build Instagram the app,” he said, “but not everybody can build Instagram the community.” Those artists, designers, and photographers were turning into evangelists for the product, and Instagram needed to keep them as excited as possible for as long as possible.\\n\\nSeptember 29, 2020", "Bigger technology companies had the resources to separate their community growth work from their content cleanup work—and usually didn’t devote so much attention to such things so early in their life cycle, because the law said they didn’t have to. But understanding the ugly potential of the platform early helped Zollman and Riedel think not just about how to address the problems, but also about how important it was to actively promote the kind of content they wanted to see. At Twitter and Facebook, executives reasoned that it was legally safer to be as uninvolved in content policing as possible. If there were problems, users could report or resolve them themselves, and it wasn’t the company’s job to tell them how to interact with the product. Riedel and Zollman saw it differently. Because Instagram didn’t have an algorithm or any way to re-share photos, there was no natural way for content to go viral. So Instagram employees had the opportunity to decide for themselves what kind of user behavior to reward, handpicking interesting profiles to highlight on their company blog. They also leaned on their users for help improving the product, asking via Instagram if anyone could volunteer to help translate the app into other languages, or if anyone could organize InstaMeets of their own around the world. They published tips for making higher-quality posts, with ideas for interesting angles and novelty perspectives, like shooting underwater. The strategy ended up creating more and more superfans, who augmented the work Zollman and Riedel were doing, for free.\\n\\nSeptember 29, 2020", "Krieger did build a re-share button but never released it to the public. The founders thought it would violate the expectations you had when you followed someone. You followed them because you wanted to see what they saw and experienced and created. Not someone else.\\n\\nSeptember 29, 2020", "Zuckerberg wasn’t sure how things would play out. But his motivation is outlined in a little red-orange book, handed down to new Facebook employees at every Monday morning orientation. On one of the last pages, against a navy backdrop, there are a few sentences in light blue writing that explain Zuckerberg’s paranoid leadership: “If we don’t create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will. The internet is not a friendly place. Things that don’t stay relevant don’t even get the luxury of leaving ruins. They disappear.” The question that Systrom would be asking, six years later, was whether Zuckerberg considered Instagram part of the “we,” or the “someone else.”\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2020", "She talked to her husband. “People who don’t take risks work for people who do,”\\n\\nOctober 9, 2020", "“The more you give up who you are to be liked by other people, it’s a formula for chipping away at your soul. You become a product of what everyone else wants, and not who you’re supposed to be.”\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2021", "She started treating several students at Systrom’s alma mater, Stanford University, where the app he created was changing campus life. Now students there agonized about having photos that were compelling enough to get into sororities and fraternities on campus. Networking in those groups would be so important for their future success, they argued. “They worry that without interesting Instagram profiles, they won’t get internships, or get noticed by their professors,” Bull explained. It wasn’t just about their social lives—Instagram had become enmeshed in their professional planning. All around the world, similar stories were playing out.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 202"]
