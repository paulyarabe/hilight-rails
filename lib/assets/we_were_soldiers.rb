book_notes = ["This is about what we did, what we saw, what we suffered in a thirty-four-day campaign in the Ia Drang Valley of the Central Highlands of South Vietnam in November 1965, when we were young and confident and patriotic and our countrymen knew little and cared less about our sacrifices.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2019", "this is a love story, told in our own words and by our own actions. We were the children of the 1950s and we went where we were sent because we loved our country. We were draftees, most of us, but we were proud of the opportunity to serve that country just as our fathers had served in World War II and our older brothers in Korea. We were members of an elite, experimental combat division trained in the new art of airmobile warfare at the behest of President John F. Kennedy.\\n\\nJanuary 13, 2019", "Another and far more transcendent love came to us unbidden on the battlefields, as it does on every battlefield in every war man has ever fought. We discovered in that depressing, hellish place, where death was our constant companion, that we loved each other. We killed for each other, we died for each other, and we wept for each other. And in time we came to love each other as brothers. In battle our world shrank to the man on our left and the man on our right and the enemy all around. We held each other’s lives in our hands and we learned to share our fears, our hopes, our dreams as readily as we shared what little else good came our way.\\n\\nJanuary 13, 2019", "Only first-place trophies will be displayed, accepted, or presented in this battalion. Second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield, and death for the individual in combat. No fat troops or officers. Decision-making will be decentralized: Push the power down. It pays off in wartime. Loyalty flows down as well. I check up on everything. I am available day or night to talk with any officer of this battalion.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2019", "Captain John D. Herren, the commander of Bravo Company. Herren, a pipe-smoking twenty-nine-year-old bachelor, was an Army brat--his father was an Army lieutenant general--and a graduate of West Point, class of 1958. He was calm, thoughtful, friendly, and steady: No one ever saw John Herren get flustered.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2019", "Once I had taken command, my goal was to create the absolute best air assault infantry battalion in the world, and the proudest. Every man in the battalion had to know and believe he was an important part of that best. We trained and tested. Senior military officials from throughout the U.S. Army and allied forces were frequent visitors to Fort Benning; the word had gone out that something new, different, and deadly in the art of warfare was being created here.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2019", "There was one bit of sobering reality that I insisted be introduced at every level in this training: We would declare a platoon leader dead and let his sergeant take over and carry out the mission. Or declare a sergeant dead and have one of his PFCs take over running the squad. We were training for war, and leaders are killed in battle. I wanted every man trained for and capable of taking over the job of the man above him.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2019", "In the American Civil War it was a matter of principle that a good officer rode his horse as little as possible. There were sound reasons for this. If you are riding and your soldiers are marching, how can you judge how tired they are, how thirsty, how heavy their packs weigh on their shoulders?I applied the same philosophy in Vietnam, where every battalion commander had his own command-and-control helicopter. Some commanders used their helicopter as their personal mount. I never believed in that.You had to get on the ground with your troops to see and hear what was happening. You have to soak up firsthand information for your instincts to operate accurately. Besides, it’s too easy to be crisp, cool, and detached at 1,500 feet; too easy to demand the impossible of your troops; too easy to make mistakes that are fatal only to those souls far below in the mud, the blood, and the confusion.\\n\\nJanuary 13, 2019", "I was tempted to join Nadal’s or Edwards’s men, but resisted the temptation. I had no business getting involved with the actions of only one company; I might get pinned down and become simply another rifleman.My duty was to lead riflemen.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2019", "when I felt a firm hand on my right shoulder. It was Sergeant Major Plumley’s. He shouted over the racket of the firefights: \\\"Sir, if you don’t find some cover you’re going to go down--and if you go down, we all go down!\\\"Plumley was right, as always. Anyone waving, yelling, hand-signaling, or talking on a radio was instantly targeted by the enemy. These guys were quick to spot and shoot leaders, radio operators, and medics. I had never fretted about being wounded in combat, in Korea or here. But Plumley brought me up short. The game was just beginning; this was no time for me to go out of it.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2019", "By now eight men of the platoon’s twenty-nine had been killed in action; another thirteen were wounded. The twenty five-yard-wide perimeter was a circle of pain, death, fear, and raw courage. Medic Charlie Lose crawled from man to man throughout the raging firefight, doing his best to patch the wounded with the limited supplies in his medical pack. Although he was wounded twice himself, Lose never slowed his pace. He would keep all thirteen of the wounded alive for twenty-six long, harrowing hours. Lose says, \\\"On several occasions I had to stand or sit up to treat the wounded. Each time the VC fired heavily at me.\\\" Lose used his .45 and an M-16 rifle to help defend his patients.\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2019", "Someone brought up a load of ammo for the machine guns.Beck says, \\\"That made me very happy. There was no one on my left for a long time. It was lonely as hell up there until a captain came over to me from my left rear and ordered me to ’stay put. You are with such-and-such a company now!’ I’ll never forget that. I can’t remember what company he said; hell, one company’s as good as another. I don’t know what the hell’s happening. I’m out there by myself. I’m only a twenty-year-old kid. I don’t know what’s going on. I followed Russell Adams; I’m his assistant gunner so I go where he goes.That’s how I got up there.\\\"\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2019", "\\\"Before I landed at Plei Me I had decided that Colonel Moore needed ammunition more than he needed additional manpower at this point. My plan was to change helicopters, then two of us loaded with ammo would go back to X-Ray. Get the ammo in and bring out the wounded. I felt we could reach the LZ if we came in hard at treetop level. If we couldn’t get back out, at least the ammo would be there and the Infantry would protect us if we could just reach the landing zone.\\\"\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2019", "\\\"When we hit the ground at Plei Me we were met by medics and the Infantry troops still waiting to be lifted into X-Ray.They removed the dead and wounded from my bird--and this act is engraved in my mind deeper than any other experience in my two tours in Vietnam.A huge black enlisted man, clad only in G.I. shorts and boots, hands bigger than dinner plates, reached into my helicopter to pick up one of the dead white soldiers. He had tears streaming down his face and he tenderly cradled that dead soldier to his chest as he walked slowly from the aircraft to the medical station. I never knew if the man he picked up was his buddy or not. I suspect not. His grief was for a fallen comrade and for the agony that violent death brings to those who witness it.\\\"\\n\\nJanuary 15, 2019", "The infantry radio channel sounded like an old war movie. Colonel Moore, Trojan 6, came across calm and commanding. [His voice] rang with courage and sound judgment. It made men of boys in X-Ray that day. \u0027, understand your situation ... keep steady ... we are going to drop artillery all around you. Get your men ... all of them ... and walk together slowly back as the shells impact. Just walk back with the artillery and you will be OK. Hang in there.’ \\\"\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "\\\"Our Huey skimmed the trees and headed north out of harm’s way. I lit up a cigarette, turned to my left an dover my shoulder saw a very bloody trooper laid out with his head in another trooper’s lap. I passed the cigarette back, lit another and stuck it in the bloody trooper’s mouth.At that moment the trooper with the bloody back looked me squarely in the eyes and gave me one of the most cherished thank you’s I have ever received.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "A commander in battle has three means of influencing the action: Fire support, now pouring down in torrents; his personal presence on the battlefield; and the use of his reserve.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "The Scriptures say that there is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends. This is what Calvin Bouknight did in that fire-filled jungle. He sheltered the wounded he was treating with his own body, his back to the enemy guns, completely vulnerable.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "Deal was helping in the evacuation of casualties when he was brought up short by a strange sight. \\\"It was at this time that one of the things I regret most about that battle occurred. I saw a line, not a column, just a line of men, probably two hundred strong, moving on my right flank in the same direction as we were about to turn, the east, and move in with our casualties. I immediately lifted my weapon, had them in my sights with a clear shot. I started to call for those near me to get their weapons up because I thought they were North Vietnamese. But it was just a little bit too far to distinguish if they were Americans or North Vietnamese, so I elected not to fire.\\\"There was also fear of drawing attention to our depleted platoon. My men were now all killed or wounded except for the equivalent of two squads, about eighteen or so left. These two hundred troops were parallel to us, making their way to the landing zone. Marm, who had been on my right, had already withdrawn. It turned out that they were some of the North Vietnamese we had to fight later that day, who inflicted fearsome casualties on us. I only regret that we didn’t stand there and start shooting them.\\\"\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "There are only three principles of warfare: Audacity, Audacity, and audacity! --General George S. Patton\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "Sergeant Sam Hollman, Jr., a native Pennsylvanian, knelt beside his mortally wounded buddy Jack Gell and heard him gasp, \\\"Tell my wife I love her.\\\"\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "Suddenly, twenty-five yards away, Deal saw an American get up and charge forward while everyone around him was flat on his belly. Says Deal, \\\"I saw him throw a grenade behind an anthill and empty his weapon into it. Then he fell to his knees. I said to myself: ’, get up, don’t be hurt.’ I didn’t know who it was; I couldn’t make out the form. There was so much battlefield haze, dust, smoke.\\\"It was Lieutenant Joe Marm. He had spotted an enemy machine gun dug into a big termite hill; it was chewing up both the Bravo Company platoons.After failing to knock it out with a LAW rocket and a thrown grenade, he decided to deal with it directly. He charged through the fire, tossed a hand grenade behind the hill, and then cleaned up the survivors with his M-16 rifle. The following day, Lieutenant Al Devney found a dead North Vietnamese officer and eleven enemy soldiers sprawled behind that termite mound. Says Deal, \\\"Joe Marm saved my life and the lives of many others.\\\"Lieutenant Marm suffered a bullet wound to his neck and jaw. Staff Sergeant Les Staley, thirty-eight, of Pike County, Kentucky, ran out and, with a private, got the wounded lieutenant to his feet. Supporting him, they joined a growing stream of walking wounded flowing back toward the battalion aid station. Sergeant Keeton treated Marm’s wound, and one of Bruce Crandalfs Hueys evacuated him to the rear. Within days, Lieutenant Joe Marm was recuperating at Valley Forge Army Hospital near his home in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "The men I talked with realized that we were facing a fierce, determined enemy, but he had failed to break through our lines. They knew the fight wasn’t over. I heard weary soldiers say things like: \\\"We’ll get ’, sir\\\" and \\\"They won’t get through us, sir.\\\" Their fighting spirit had not dimmed, and they made me proud and humble. In every one of my companies that had landed in this place this morning there were fifteen to twenty soldiers who had less than two weeks left to go in the Army. Some of those men now lay dead, wrapped in ponchos, near my command post. The rest of them were on that perimeter, standing shoulder to shoulder with their buddies, ready to continue the fight.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "I had concluded that the American people had a right to know what their sons were doing in this war, on the ground, in the field. I welcomed visiting reporters to my battalion and, later, to my brigade. I told them they could go anywhere they wanted with my troopers, with only two restrictions: Don’t put out any information that will endanger us, and don’t interfere with operations. I never had cause to regret that openness.\\n\\nJanuary 16, 2019", "A brave Captain is as a root, out of which as branches the courage of his soldiers cloth spring.--Sir Phillip Sidney\\n\\nJanuary 17, 2019", "The sergeant came up to me and said: \\\"You boys must have put up a hell of a fight.’ I said: ’, it wasn’t us. The credit belongs to them.’ I pointed toward some of the American dead--the men of Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry.\\\"\\n\\nJanuary 18, 2019", "There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell.--William Tecumseh\\n\\nJanuary 19, 2019", "SFC Clarence W. Blount of Pensacola, Florida, was chief of a firing section in Captain Davis’s battery. Almost twenty years later he wrote me: \\\"I remember you and Sergeant Major Plumley came to our gun position and you gave our entire unit a fine speech for the great artillery support that we provided during the battle at X-Ray. That speech made a lasting impression on me. I felt that my usefulness to my country, the Army and my unit was really at its peak at that time. I have been wanting to say that to someone for a long time.\\\"\\n\\nJanuary 23, 201"]
