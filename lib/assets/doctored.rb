book_notes = ["Today medicine is just another profession, and doctors have become like everybody else: insecure, discontented, and anxious about the future. In surveys, a majority of doctors express diminished enthusiasm for medicine and say they would discourage a friend or family member from entering the profession. In a 2008 survey of twelve thousand physicians, only 6 percent described their morale as positive. Eighty-four percent said their incomes were constant or decreasing. The majority said they did not have enough time to spend with patients because of paperwork, and nearly half said they planned to reduce the number of patients they would see in the next three years or stop practicing altogether. American doctors are suffering from a collective malaise. We strove, made sacrifices, and for what? For many, the job has become only that—a job.\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "Insensitivity in patient-doctor interactions has become almost normal.\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "By the time patients get to me, they have already seen their internist and cardiologist. They have had their echos and caths. Still, I feel an obligation to examine them. When I listen to their hearts, I make sure to put my hand on their shoulder to convey a sense of warmth. I think it is enormously important to touch patients before I cut into them\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "A big problem was a lack of health literacy—patients not knowing that they needed to eliminate salt from their diets or take their medications regularly, for example—which was due in no small part to inadequate teaching on the part of their care providers. A typical complaint from patients was that their doctors had told them they had weak hearts but never told them why. “I spent two weeks in the hospital, but no one ever talked to me about it,” one patient told me. “They never said, ‘This is what is happening. This is what you can expect.’ In fact, no one ever talked to me about it until now.\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "May 29, 2017", "Who hugs you, Doctor?” I laughed. “No one.” The sheer arduousness of taking care of a newborn had sapped the romantic energy at home. “Don’t look at me,” John quickly interjected. “I’ll give you a hug,” she said. Embarrassed, I shook my head. “No, that’s all right.” “No, it’s not all right. Come here. Give me a hug.” She struggled to sit up, swaying from side to side to pull up her three hundred or so pounds. Then she grabbed hold of me. “If you get fifteen hugs a day, all your problems will be solved.”\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "[She] squeezed the air out of me. “No, I’m serious,” she said. “A hug does something to your inside.” (No question about that, I thought, feeling my spleen being crushed.)\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "Another doctor wrote: “The whole ‘apologize and hope it goes away’ thing is such a phony myth perpetuated by ethics types who don’t have to worry about career ruin in the lawyer gang-bang that is U.S. health care.” And another wrote: “It’s like confessing an extramarital affair to your spouse. What do you expect to accomplish?” However, studies have shown that physicians’ apologies do not necessarily increase malpractice lawsuits. In fact, they might protect against litigation. In surveys patients say they desire acknowledgment of even minor errors. For both moderate and severe mistakes, patients are significantly more likely to sue if a physician does\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "a lawyer for the hospital said that at some point in our careers every one of us would likely be sued, and that we could even be sued during residency. She offered some advice: document your decision-making; document when a patient refuses treatment; never admit wrongdoing; never talk to an opposing attorney; and finally, be nice to your patients. Doctors who were nice to their patients were rarely sued, even in cases of egregious malpractice.\\n\\nMay 29, 2017", "May 29, 2017", "The story of this patient is one we encountered almost every day my first year at LIJ: a heart attack victim taken by ambulance to a community hospital that isn’t equipped to perform angioplasty. If the man had been brought to LIJ, which has cardiac catheterization available twenty-four hours a day, the damage to his heart could have been averted, adding years to his life. But it would have required a degree of coordination and oversight that many ambulance fleets in New York and across the country lack. We discussed many such cases at hospital meetings on how to shorten door-to-balloon (D2B) time, the time between hospital arrival and balloon angioplasty for patients having heart attacks. In 1971, Eugene Braunwald, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School, proposed a radical hypothesis: “Time is muscle.” He postulated that acute myocardial infarction is a dynamic process and that cardiac injury could be reduced by expeditious intervention. Many studies since then have demonstrated that shorter D2B time is strongly associated with survival\\n\\nMay 31, 2017", "More important, patients don’t always require specialists. Patients often have “overlap syndromes” (we used to call it aging), which cannot be compartmentalized into individual problems and are probably best managed by a good general physician. When specialists are called in, they are apt to view each problem through the lens of their specific organ expertise. (Perhaps the hardest thing in medicine is to do nothing, especially when you’re called for help.) Patients generally end up worse-off. I have seen it over and over again.\\n\\nMay 31, 2017", "May 31, 2017", "referrals are probably unnecessary, and there is plenty of evidence that wasteful expert consultation is adding to health costs and creating redundant care. But as a full-fledged doctor I appreciate the business. It is hard not to view a referral as an overture from another physician, and it is equally hard not to return the favor. However, referrals can put you into a moral bind. Should you refer patients back to certain doctors—not necessarily the best doctors; sometimes even assholes who aren’t particularly good with their patients—just to sustain your business? It is a paradox of specialized medicine. Specialists are better paid than primary care physicians, but they are also less autonomous because unlike primary care physicians, they depend on other doctors for referrals. So there is tremendous pressure on specialists to keep referral sources happy, especially in doctor-saturated areas like Long Island.\\n\\nMay 31, 2017", "May 31, 2017", "My parents were supposed to fly out the following day. I felt a vague longing for them to stay. My heart ached when I remembered how Dad used to return from research conferences with a bag of airplane peanuts or a couple of Brach’s candies for his kids.\\n\\nJune 3, 2017", "I wasn’t sure why I was crying. In human physiology there is the concept of referred pain, in which a painful sensation is perceived to be in a different place from where the injury actually has occurred, and so it is with emotions, too. It wasn’t just about my job or financial frustrations but something else: my relationship with my father, how he was with me—or perhaps just how he was. He had been so detached while I was growing up. I had always been desperate for his approval.\\n\\nJune 3, 2017", "Now that we have come up with a plan, don’t rehash everything. Keep yourself busy. An idle brain is the devil’s workshop, so keep as busy as possible. And when you go to work, work! The job has to be your first priority. And move to Long Island to be closer to your job.”\\n\\nJune 3, 2017", "Go after exactly what you want, not what you want. For you never get anything but the things that you exactly wanted. —Alan Gregg, twentieth-century physician\\n\\nJune 3, 2017", "1867 the Aetna Guide to Fire Insurance introduced the concept of moral hazard into actuarial science. The publication warned that generous insurance policies could make some people careless about preventing fires. Protected in part from the consequences of their actions, those people were more likely to engage in risky behavior, like not clearing their yards of brush or leaving their houses without adequate ventilation. The guide made a revolutionary and counterintuitive point: insurance in some cases can increase risk. Moral hazard undoubtedly plays a role in health care, too. When people complain that their rising insurance premiums are funding others’ irresponsible behavior, they are complaining about moral hazard\\n\\nJune 3, 2017", "My doc-of-the-day patients were often frustrating to manage, and not just because of the volume. A big reason was their limited resources. They rarely saw a doctor regularly, and poverty and lack of health insurance or social support were constant stressors in their lives. A social worker on one of my cases told me that for most patients, domestic problems or destructive habits were entrenched. There was little that could be done for them in the hospital, and patients were often lost to follow-up after discharge. She did the best she could, but there was only so much that could be done. Though she was trained as a clinical psychologist, most of her work revolved around mundane issues like insurance forms and discharge planning\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "I smiled at John’s gravity, but he was right, of course. We so often waste our borrowed time. I had seen so much death the past four years, seen so many patients come and go. A few weeks prior, when I had been in line at the hospital deli to buy an iced coffee, a woman in front of me paid for her drink, picked up a laptop computer and a sheaf of papers, and turned to me in my white coat and said, “He’s probably dead by now, my husband,” and walked out\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "the single greatest problem in medicine today is the disrespect of time. One cannot do anything in medicine well on the fly.” So, racing through patient encounters, you practice with an ever-present fear that you will miss something, hurt someone, and open yourself up to legal (not to mention moral) liability. To cope with the anxiety, you start to call in “experts” for problems that perhaps you could have handled yourself if you had had more time to think through the case. Apart from the perverse incentives of our fee-for-service system, a major driver of overconsultation is the uncertainty engendered by the hurried pace of contemporary medicine.\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "There are many things doctors could do to reduce hospital readmission rates. They could ensure that discharged patients get timely follow-up appointments. (In the New England Journal study, half of all medical patients readmitted within thirty days had not visited a doctor after discharge.) They could do a better job of ensuring that patients obtained their medications and understood how to take them. When I was a fellow, one of my elderly patients bounced back to the hospital simply because she’d missed her morning dose of diuretic on the day after discharge. Though I’d given her prescriptions and gone over the dosing schedule, I hadn’t checked whether there was someone available to drive to the pharmacy to get her medications, an oversight that resulted in a $10,000 rehospitalization. Doctors could also do a better job of educating patients about which symptoms and signs presage worsening of their disease—shortness of breath and leg swelling in congestive heart failure, for example\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "We know that patients with a clear understanding of discharge instructions are 30 percent less likely to return to the hospital. But research shows inconsistency at best in achieving these goals. After so many years in medicine, I am convinced of one thing: The vast majority of doctors aren’t bad. It is the system that makes us bad, makes us make mistakes. Most doctors—and this is certainly true of my colleagues at the hospital—are willing to stay late and work hard to provide good care. But they are struggling to do so in a system that is diseased\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "As is so often the case in our health care system, doctors’ incentives do not serve broader social goals. This virtually guarantees that proposed reforms like cutting readmissions, reducing unnecessary testing, and adopting computerized medical records will fail. The agency that runs Medicare is considering giving bonuses to hospitals that lower readmissions below the average. Though I think it’s a good idea, I believe some of this money should be shared with doctors. Current law prohibits hospitals from paying doctors for reducing hospital services, even if the goal is to provide more efficient care. But such “gainsharing” will align physicians’ incentives with cost-cutting goals. Our system, structured to encourage overutilization, needs to provide some inducements to reduce the amount of health care, too\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "Work out what things in life you care about, the beliefs you hold near and dear, and stick to them\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "The past four years at LIJ had been such a turbulent time, both professionally and personally. I’d been so occupied with the heavy lifting of establishing my career that I hadn’t given much thought to my “value system” or to the kind of doctor—and I don’t mean specialist—that I wanted to be\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "In surveys, most physicians—even the dissatisfied ones—say the best part of their jobs is taking care of people. I believe this is the key to coping with the stresses of contemporary medicine: identifying what is important to you, what you believe in, and what you will fight for. For me, I’ve learned, it’s the human moments, such as the house call with Hyman Gesselman. The human moments are what others—the lawyers, the bankers—envy about our profession, and no company, no agency, no entity can take those away.\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "June 13, 201"]
