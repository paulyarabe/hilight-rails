book_notes = ["The company was creating itself to conceive of and design and build small molecules better than the world’s most skilled, profitable, and heavily endowed research organizations and what it took from the scientists was utter commitment, extreme passion, thrilling insight, and fearlessness\\n\\nApril 23, 2018", "Within weeks Boger would announce that he had hired perhaps the most famous crystallographer in the pharmaceutical business, Manuel Navia. In 1988, in the record time of three months, Navia had led a team that found the structure of a major protein that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus to replicate, a feat of such stunning general interest and public relations value to his employer that it landed him improbably on the Today show.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Working most nights until ten, he then stayed up past midnight reading scientific journals, like his father. He worked every Saturday in a den off the kitchen at home. When he left the house now to drive to Logan Airport, as he often did, his two-year-old son refused to kiss him good-bye.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "In halting English, she reported on recent animal experiments in which the entire lower viscera of rats—liver, kidneys, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, large and small bowel, everything but the spleen—were successfully transplanted using FK-506. Such experiments had been tried previously with cyclosporine, but none of the rats had survived more than thirteen days. However, Murase’s animals had lived as long as seventy-two days (some would eventually live more than seven months), with no evidence of rejection even after she had discontinued the drug. Incredibly, the surviving rats had all put on weight.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "“The literature on transplantation of the kidney and other organs was uncompromisingly pessimistic, and therefore, paradoxically attractive,” wrote Starzl, who, it will be recalled, feared failure more than death. “This looked like the vacuum I was seeking.” As if to ensure that nothing in the path he chose for himself would be even remotely easy, Starzl decided to concentrate again on the liver\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Borel himself is more sanguine. “I’m afraid the definition of a scientist,” he has said, “is a man who can take frustration without end.”\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Like many others, he’d heard that a Japanese surgeon named Takio Ochiai had data on a new immunosuppressant that was one hundred times more potent than cyclosporine. Rumors of new drugs were not unusual at such meetings, and Ochiai, a middle-level professor at Chiba University, was assigned a small room to speak in. Quickly, it filled to overflowing. Borel was there. So was Calne. People attracted by the crowd pressed three- and four-deep at the doorway, straining to hear.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Ochiai’s data were tantalizing. Experimenting mainly with beagles imported from the United States, he showed that the new compound, FK-506, worked in much the same way as cyclosporine by slowing the proliferation of T cells. Like cyclosporine, the molecule had shown up in a soil screen. It had been discovered in a dirt sample taken from the lower slope of Mount Tsukuba, an hour by train from Tokyo and just a few kilometers from the central screening facility of its discoverer, Fujisawa, the third-largest drug company in Japan. (FK-506 was an abbreviation of the molecule’s identification number, FK-506009.) Like cyclosporine, FK-506 also appeared to be toxic.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Calne’s dog studies were at least ambiguous and should not stop the drug’s progress. (“Drugs kill dogs,” says Boger about the animal’s well-known proclivity for showing side effects unobserved in other species, “and dogs kill drugs.”) Working closely with the FDA, which sanctions all such clinical trials in the United States, Starzl’s team produced compelling enough evidence to warrant testing the drug in people.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "FK-506 was probably going to be a blockbuster drug: It would steal the transplant market from cyclosporine and would probably be safe enough to open up the autoimmune market. But, the Times article notwithstanding, it was unlikely to be safe enough to capture that market as well, so the greatest prize would be left for the next generation of compounds. Vertex couldn’t have asked for a better scenario\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "Without their own leads, many of the companies would now likely end up looking to underwrite a small specialized research partner, which played directly into Vertex’s strategy.\\n\\nApril 24, 2018", "But Waksman worried especially about the appropriateness of having turned over streptomycin to one company, however well intentioned, for “exploitation.” Appealing to George Merck personally, he asked to be released from his contract. Merck willingly agreed. Tishler, who had watched his sister die of TB, was struck by Merck’s magnanimity: “He used to say that if we discovered a cure for cancer, he’d not patent it,” Tishler would say. “How can you keep it away from people? How can you charge a lot of money? What’s the excuse? You can’t do that.”\\n\\nMay 2, 2018", "For an extra-credit question on a final in medicinal chemistry, Tishler offered $50,000 to any student who could develop a synthetic step that was cheaper than using microbes for making vitamin C. Like everyone else, Boger couldn’t find one—the drug industry had been toying with the question unsuccessfully for almost forty years—but the problem itself qualified all Boger’s assumptions about what science ought to be and what he wanted to do with it.\\n\\nMay 2, 2018", "the companies had prepared themselves by importing technology and becoming virtuosos within the existing sphere: FK-506, a triumph of screening, was the first potential blockbuster drug developed wholly by a Japanese firm. They were supported by an activist government that in 1980 made developing pharmaceuticals for export a national priority. Having telescoped in less than forty-five years the entire evolution of industrial research from coal tar dyes to microprocessors, Japanese science, recapitulating the U.S. model, was now chasing the world’s most complex, powerful, and profitable molecules. All it needed was direction.\\n\\nMay 3, 2018", "Then I learned synthetic chemistry, and that was truly exciting. I realized that it was much like studying architecture. You have this complex target molecule and a large collection of reaction processes. Then you have to analyze logically a sequence of reactions that will take simple materials and convert them to complicated materials, just like building a new building. There are an infinite number of solutions, but some are clearly characterized by elegance and efficiency. There is an aesthetic appeal to the way you assemble a certain number of these smaller fragments and they just snap together.\\n\\nMay 6, 2018", "Schreiber, for instance, subscribes to a service that reviews all European patent applications, which issue ahead of those in the United States and thus are a frequent first indication of new molecules. Boger complements his own “rabid” reading by foraging widely among an array of data banks and computerized searches. Information junkies, both of them are always looking for anything to give themselves a fresh edge. Now, in mid-1987, both suddenly saw something obscure on the horizon that hit them equally with the force of a revelation: FK-506.\\n\\nMay 6, 2018", "Industrywide, fewer than one in ten programs yields a drug: No company, no matter how smart, can survive on a single project. Worse for start-ups, they are often marginalized to the most speculative, high-risk areas of business\\n\\nMay 7, 2018", "Science is rarely, if ever, linear, and information isn’t necessarily most useful in answering those questions that elicit it in the first place.\\n\\nMay 7, 2018", "Renin, the protein-cleaving enzyme on which Boger had done his career-making work at Merck, was a perfect example. No renin blocker had ever become a drug despite a decade of intensive research efforts at Merck and elsewhere. But trying to inhibit renin had prepared the industry for HIV protease, which is strikingly similar.\\n\\nMay 7, 2018", "Vertex wouldn’t pick the project that would benefit the most people or target the most pressing need; no company would. It would pick the project with the best overall chance of success, which first meant having a good story to tell investors. In that arena, by late 1990, AIDS was a tough sell. Perhaps the toughest.\\n\\nMay 7, 2018", "“Listen, if I told you I had a harmless pill that, if you took it every day and had a heart attack, would reduce your chances of permanent heart damage by 40 percent, wouldn’t you take it?” “The FDA’s never approved anything like that,” Navia said. “Yes, it has,” Boger said. “Aspirin.”\\n\\nMay 7, 2018", "Boger, as always, led by example. He was upbeat, dauntless, equable, tireless, and expansive. Flipping between business and science, between existing work and planning ahead, he was in Zen field general mode, calmly and gregariously attending areas away from the main action that he was certain would be crucial later on. Like Tishler, he kept “all the threads in his own hands” but seldom pulled on the ones that the scientists expected or wanted him to.\\n\\nMay 7, 2018", "“In biology, even in the best circumstances, if one day out of five is productive, you’re doing well,”\\n\\nMay 7, 2018", "economics of drug development, where 70 percent of the overall cost arises after a drug candidate is identified\\n\\nMay 8, 2018", "He now believed that the drugs worked not by inhibiting protein folding but by interfering with a far more complex process called signal transduction.\\n\\nMay 8, 2018", "Far from feeling that he had abrogated morality, Navia believed he was practicing a higher ethic. “My personal mission is to use this methodology to make drugs,” he says. “I’m not an academic. When you work in a place like this, and you’re cranking out a structure in four months or nine months, you’re cutting a lot of corners. You’re supposed to cut corners. My job here is not to provide perfect structural information. It’s to provide adequate structural information\\n\\nMay 9, 2018", "“This,” he says, “is the essence of what I was trying to communicate to Mason—that for us to have taken a year and a half or two years to solve the structure of HIV protease would have been immoral. You can’t. There are people out there dropping like flies . . . “So you cut the corner, you get the structure, you buy somebody a month.”\\n\\nMay 9, 2018", "To the scientists, Nature’s second reversal in a month was illuminating, improbable, and not without its jealousies. “This is the value of working in hot areas,” Moore told Harding. “Science and Nature have no idea whether any of these structures are right, but they’d obviously rather publish shitty structures of important proteins than exquisite structures of boring proteins.” Swept up in the tide of anti-Schreiberism, he added, “We’re going to spoil his party. We’re going to be a very sharp dart in his ass.”\\n\\nMay 9, 2018", "“I’ve learned from being here, you just find the next experiment to do. That’s what keeps us from destroying ourselves.”\\n\\nMay 9, 2018", "“The sin in science is not making mistakes,” he said, hungrily spooning out more vegetables for himself. “It’s overinterpreting your data. If you’re disproved by a massive amount of new data, that’s fine. What you don’t want to be is disproven by a little more data. That means you went almost but not far enough.”\\n\\nMay 9, 2018", "Eidelman stood his ground. He would not make any claims for the drug, only report his findings. Starzl, smiling through gritted teeth, accepted his decision. “One of the things about discovery,” he lectured, “is that you’ve got to know you’ve discovered something. You don’t want to be afraid all the time.”\\n\\nMay 10, 2018", "But Boger wasn’t there, which, to the scientists, was just the point. By running the company’s business, by isolating himself out of necessity but also self-righteousness, he had also isolated them, stranding them in a world that thrives at the forefront on access and collaboration.\\n\\nMay 10, 2018", "Quietly, he began recruiting Vicki Sato, head of research at Biogen, Aldrich’s first firm, to oversee the company’s science. It was an admission that the demands of chasing money had overwhelmed his ability to do active science and that his ultimate role, in a world dictated by business, was (to use an overused word) in “growing” the company. Boger retained final control of the projects and continued to be their driving force, but Sato, a quick, street-smart no-nonsense former biology professor at Harvard would be the company’s field commander, the person responsible for keeping it on track and on time. Boger hired her, he said, in part to make peace with the company’s biologists, many of whom still distrusted him over calcineurin.\\n\\nMay 11, 2018", "Science was too difficult for people to engage in solely because, as he had written at age thirteen, they wanted “to help rid man of the burden of disease . . . and to help man get along with man.” They did it because they were absolutely certain it could be done, and to prove to themselves and the world that they could do it first. They did it to bash their competitors, to think themselves divine, to win, and to avoid the terrible, deathly anguish of losing.\\n\\nMay 11, 2018"]
