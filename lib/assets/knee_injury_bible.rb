book_notes = ["the knee is the most common joint injured by adolescent athletes, responsible for approximately 2.5 million emergency department visits per year. And all the force the knee joint is exposed to day in and day out, combined with the high prevalence of acute injuries, helps explain why the knee is also the most common joint to be affected by arthritis. Nearly one in five adults over age forty-five have knee osteoarthritis.\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "May 22, 2021", "The patellofemoral joint, in particular, is an extremely complex joint that is frequently a source of pain for many patients. The kneecap is vital to extend and bend the knee. It allows for greater strength and mobility of the knee joint. The kneecap is flat on the front and has a V shape on the back. That V interacts with a groove that the femur has on its end, which is called the trochlea ; the V slides up and down in that groove.\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "The pain generated from this joint commonly comes from the grinding of the back of the patella on the V area of the femur it slides within. This can happen from overuse with time\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "The tibiofemoral joint is composed of two rounded structures from the femur (known as the femoral condyles), which interact with two roughly flat structures from the tibia (the tibial plateaus).\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "The surfaces of every bone that participate in forming a joint are covered with a layer of gristle (cartilage) that gives them an extremely smooth surface so they can move without friction and protect the underlying bone from damage.\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "The joint is also filled with a small amount of fluid that allows for improved and frictionless motion, therefore reducing wear on the cartilage. This fluid is created by the joint lining or capsule—imagine a small, thick bag that encompasses the whole joint.\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "Between the femur and tibia are two structures that act as a cushion for the knee joint: the medial and lateral meniscus . These structures are tough and rubbery, which allows them to function as a “shock absorber” inside the knee to prevent the direct contact of the leg bones, diminishing the load that the tibia receives with every step or even more during landing (when jumping or running) or when lifting weights. These structures have a C shape and are referred to by three zones: a front part (anterior horn), a middle part (body), and a portion on the back (posterior horn). Furthermore, they are strongly attached to the tibia so they are not displaced during knee motion, through the meniscal roots. These root attachments are really important because if they are injured, the meniscus stops working, letting all the load that comes from the femur go directly to the tibia.\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "In addition, fat deposits around the knee, known as articular fat pads , help with knee motion and to cushion the knee from external stress. One of the most important is located below and behind the kneecap, the infrapatellar fat pad , which absorbs from the front of the knee (like an airbag) and cushions the patellar tendon as it moves when the knee flexes and extends.\\n\\nMay 22, 2021", "May 22, 2021", "an acute meniscal tear (tearing the shock absorbers in your knee) can lead to chronic joint pain and osteoarthritis down the road.\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "Direct, or contact, injuries are those caused by an external blow or force—a collision with another person, for example, during a tackle in rugby or football or being struck with an object like a hockey stick. Indirect, or noncontact, injuries result from internal forces built up by the actions of the performer, such as over-stretching, poor technique, fatigue, and lack of fitness. Direct injuries cannot be prevented because one cannot predict these events, but indirect injuries can be prevented by appropriate exercise and training programs.\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "As mentioned, some issues of misalignment are less easy to spot. There are subtle differences that would take some sort of imaging, such as an x-ray, to reveal. One example is how much slant there is on the top of your tibia from front to back (tibial slope). A higher degree of slope is correlated with an increased risk of tearing your ACL. That is a very specific academic fact you do not need to memorize; there will not be a test! However, it just goes to show there are numerous variants when it comes to alignment and anatomy that can lead to injury.\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "The ability to bend that far is known as hypermobility. And if you meet enough criteria and receive a high Beighton hypermobility score (because of those same X-Men–like bending abilities we just mentioned), you are even given that as a medical diagnosis. This means the tissue that composes your ligaments and tendons, called collagen, is a little bit stretchier than it should be. This also means your joints move way farther than they should in multiple directions, which leads to more force on your ligaments and therefore an increased risk of injury.\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "Muscle Imbalance. If you haven’t noticed a trend yet, we want to call attention to it right now: for proper function of your knee, and your body as a whole, you need balance. You have probably heard the saying “everything in moderation.” This is true when it comes to what we eat, how we live, and also, the muscles that move your body. Remember, the knee’s main movements are simple: flexion and extension. The two main muscle groups that control these movements are your quadriceps on the front of your thigh (knee extension) and your hamstrings at the back of your knee (knee flexion).\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "Too much strength in one group or the other can lead to increased forces across your knee. For example, if your quadriceps are much stronger than your hamstrings, this leads to an increased risk of an ACL tear. Your hamstrings help pull your tibia backward, while the quadriceps help pull the tibia forward. ACL tears happen when your tibia moves too far to the front relative to its normal alignment with the femur, while it is rotated toward the outside, creating a huge stress on the ligament.\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "Being female does convey a significantly greater risk for knee injury, specifically for an ACL injury. So what does the knee have against women? That answer can be found in the aforementioned anatomical risk factors. Almost all are more common in women. Women are far more likely to be hypermobile, far more likely to have more fragile bones, more likely to have quadriceps that are stronger than their hamstrings, and also more likely to have some of the bony alignment abnormalities noted, such as an increased posterior tibial slope.\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "On top of all of this, in general, women tend to have smaller ligaments, tendons, and bones, which can withstand less force and are therefore at an increased risk for injury. One other risk factor involved specifically in ACL injuries in women is their landing biomechanics—how they land after a jump. Women tend to land with their knees more extended, or straight, and also more in a valgus (knock-kneed) position. Both of these positions tend to put more strain on the ACL and therefore are associated with an increased risk of injury.\\n\\nMay 23, 2021", "not only does carrying extra weight increase the daily toll on your knees, but it also creates greater risk for suffering an acute knee injury. That extra weight can manifest as extra force during dangerous movements. Also, carrying extra weight tends to disrupt your balance and coordination.\\n\\nMay 25, 2021", "We always ask patients, “Have you previously felt this pain?” or “Have you ever had a knee injury?” One of the main causes of arthritis is previous trauma to the knee. Cartilage injury is largely irreversible and progressive—unfortunately, once you have damaged your cartilage, it will continue to worsen, and it is just a matter of at what rate we try to slow it down. How this happens is a somewhat complex process that involves a lot of big words that even bore doctors, but we will summarize it briefly here. We have already talked about the bones, ligaments, and meniscus involved in the function of your knee joint. The bones provide the alignment and some stability, the ligaments similarly provide stability, the meniscus cushions the bones from rubbing against one another as well as providing some stability, and the cartilage helps things to move smoothly. What happens with injury is one of these things gets “broken” or “torn” and loses its function. This causes a cascade effect that changes the function of the other involved components. For example, a torn ACL makes your tibia move differently compared to your femur. This change in the biomechanics (movement of your knee) puts extra strain on your other ligaments as well as your meniscus.\\n\\nMay 25, 2021", "causes your meniscus to wear out sooner, which eventually causes breakdown of your cartilage, and you feel arthritis pain. Or let’s go in another direction. You experience a tibial plateau fracture (more information to come in Chapter 3), which causes your joint alignment to be off. Even a couple of millimeters of misalignment could completely change the force on different parts of your knee, which also changes how you move and thereby leads to wear on your meniscus and your cartilage leading to… you guessed it, arthritis. The key point is that sometimes even if you can’t feel it early on, the effects of an injury can be long-lasting and progressive. With that in mind, once you have had a significant knee injury, your aim should be to address the injury and try to minimize other factors that can worsen the health of your knee.\\n\\nMay 25, 2021", "It’s important to note that all these measures are extremely important regardless of the specifics of the knee injury or future treatment needed. Reducing swelling and inflammation is always the first step. Even if you don’t wind up needing surgery, the first step for a successful outcome is to diminish the inflammation and swelling so that you can better work on knee motion. If a surgery turns out to be required, having your knee with less inflammation and with an acceptable range of motion (full extension to 90 degrees of flexion) will not only make your surgery feasible but also improve your postoperative outcomes.\\n\\nJune 15, 2021", "The “six-week rule” is a good one to follow for bumps, bruises, strains, and sprains. Most benign injuries will improve by six weeks. If not, it is something that warrants a visit to the doctor’s office.\\n\\nJune 15, 2021", "Many times, patients ask if they really need to get an x-ray. It is usually the first step because it is one of the most useful tests and helps provide vital information for one’s diagnosis. It is an important tool to confirm or rule out fractures and the possible presence of tumors. Sometimes patients ask if instead of an x-ray they should get an MRI. In many cases an x-ray is actually much more useful than an MRI because doing an MRI alone won’t allow a doctor to get a complete understanding of most knee injuries. It’s less costly and less time-consuming, too. Many knee injuries are better diagnosed by x-ray, and information such as knee alignment, bone quality (an x-ray can detect osteopenia, or thinning of the bone), and the extent of osteoarthritis (joint space narrowing, bone spurs) is better assessed this way. Getting an x-ray is relatively simple. It takes three to four minutes depending on the number of x-rays your doctor requested.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "An MRI is useful when a doctor suspects that there is a soft tissue (ligaments, tendons, meniscus, cartilage) injury. This machine uses a magnetic field with radio waves and a computer to create a detailed picture of your knee in every dimension. An MRI lets the doctor see not only bone but also cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and even blood vessels (see Figure 2.6). MRI machines are classified according to their power in Teslas (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 3 Teslas). Usually, a 3 Tesla machine will be a newer and better machine; if you can, ask to have your study in one.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "For a knee MRI, you’ll go in feet first, and only your lower body will be in the tube.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "Expect to hold still for around thirty to forty-five minutes, while the machine makes images of your knee. During the exam, you’re usually alone in the room. Technicians running the machine will be outside and are able to communicate with you via a two-way intercom. Some patients are anxious about the MRI machine and ask if they can use an open machine instead of a closed one. Instead of a closed tube, the open MRI uses a magnet on the top and the bottom and is open on all four sides. This makes it better for patients that experience claustrophobia or panic attacks and allows bigger patients to be able to make use of an MRI to accurately diagnose their problems. Nonetheless, the images are of lesser quality because open machines aren’t as strong. If you can tolerate the closed MRI machine, this will always be a better option. If you are unsure if you will be able to withstand this study, ask the medical staff for a sedative or anti-anxiety drug to take during the test and use earplugs (MRI machines tend to be very noisy).\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "An MRI is usually not necessary immediately after a minor injury and can be deferred. If your doctor feels that your physical examination is completely normal, and your x-rays do not show any injury, further studies can be delayed until it’s clear the symptoms have not improved. MRIs are expensive and can take thirty to forty-five minutes. If there is no suspicion of further soft tissue injury unable to be diagnosed by x-rays and a physical exam, then they can be avoided.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "A CT scan is like having a hundred x-rays at once. A CT scan is usually ordered when a doctor wants to see bone-related issues\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "Often, you’ll feel a pop when the ACL tears. This is due to a bone bruise, which can be considered a prefracture, with enough force to bruise but not break the bone, as a result of the joint slipping on itself and the bones banging against each other. This most commonly occurs on the outside of the knee, where the back of the tibia bangs against the front of the femur. About 75 percent of people who have an ACL tear will have bone bruises on the outside of their knee, and the presence of these bone bruises can be a sign that the ACL is not working, even if the MRI scan is unclear.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "The ACL is supplied by the middle genicular artery. For this reason, it is common within the first twenty-four hours after an ACL tear to end up with a very swollen knee as a result of bleeding. It’s important to immediately ice it to try to minimize this bleeding because blood in the joint is not good for it. Blood and increased inflammation are nightmares for cartilage health. This inflammation can further damage cartilage and also lead to an environment prone to developing scar tissue, which leads to stiffness and long-term complications.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "Studies have shown that about 50 percent of people who have suffered an ACL tear will get post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) within twenty years. The two most determining factors are a delay in treatment and your age at the time of your ACL tear. The older you are, the more likely you will get osteoarthritis after an ACL tear.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "So what are your options? The conservative approach consists of nonsurgical treatment: mainly rest, ice, Tylenol (acetaminophen), physical therapy, and often the use of a brace. Sometimes certain injections can be tried, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), or other healing stimulants. These options will be discussed at length in Chapter 11; the science behind them is still not definitive. Physical therapy will focus on your regaining good functional range of motion, preventing long-term stiffness, and improving muscular strength, specifically hamstring strength.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "Approximately three hundred thousand ACL injuries in the United States each year.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "An otherwise healthy sixteen-year-old female soccer player. That is the sport and age group most at risk; however, any athlete who participates in sports that require quick changes of direction or of speed is at risk.\\n\\nJune 16, 2021", "Any damage to a cartilage surface is effectively arthritis (see Figure 3.2). (If you’ve been diagnosed with chondromalacia , or cartilage damage [see here], that’s a kind term for early arthritis.) The cartilage on the end of your bones is a unique organ. It is very efficient at absorbing shock and allowing us to participate in activities. But once the cartilage is damaged or starts to wear out, more stress is placed across the joint, the bone can become deformed, and your knee alignment can change. This can lead to an acceleration of the arthritis process over time.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "The cartilage has four main layers. The surface layer is the strongest. Once the surface layer is broken, the remaining deeper layers start to wear out more rapidly. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the surface layer does not break, or if there is some cartilage wear, that you adapt your activity levels so the rest of the cartilage does not wear out faster.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "Whether the arthritis is due to injury or simply genetic, try to develop a plan to ensure that it does not progress further. Surface cartilage changes may be able to be treated with activity modification and exercises such that you do not cause any further problems. This could include strengthening your quadriceps muscles so that one has the best absorption and avoiding any significant impact or running activities after one has the a nonrepairable meniscus tear trimmed out. Deeper cartilage problems are more problematic because we do not have cures for arthritis even with today’s technology.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "a total knee replacement has a shelf life. Its metal and plastic components do not last forever, and therefore this is not a procedure we like to perform in younger patients unless absolutely necessary. Often fifteen to twenty years is the expected survival of the components, although there are reports of them lasting thirty years or more. While the surgery can be redone, it becomes more complicated, and the outcomes, while still pretty good, are not as good as the first time around. With all this in mind, we try to maximize nonsurgical treatment and postpone the need for replacement as long as possible in our younger patients.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "For small, partial-thickness cartilage lesions, a trimming, called a chondroplasty, may be indicated.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "Chondroplasty and clean-out procedures (see here) often provide short-term relief but aren’t a long-term solution.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "Knee replacement (arthroplasty) procedures allow for a return to most low-impact activities, like golf, walking, sometimes light jogging, some tennis, and day-to-day activities.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "In some athletes who participate in regular repetitive activities, such as cycling, hiking, or long-distance running, the IT band can rub against a bump of bone called the lateral epicondyle on the outside of the knee. Over time, this can cause significant irritation and possible thickening of the IT band at this location. The condition is usually diagnosed by having pain when you push on the lateral epicondyle and bend your knee back and forth. For athletes who develop IT band friction syndrome, it typically starts about two miles into a run. That’s when the IT band will start to get further irritated, causing the tissue to get quite sore. Treatment is almost always an IT band stretching program (see below), combined with a low-impact lower-extremity strengthening program. Almost all cases of IT band friction syndrome can be treated without surgery.\\n\\nJune 25, 2021", "The menisci are essential shock absorbers to the knee. A torn meniscus is commonly treated by surgically trimming the meniscus. Nonetheless, when you lose your menisci, it usually leads to the development of osteoarthritis. It is thought that one of the main reasons why the incidence of knee replacements is increasing dramatically is because more people are having their menisci trimmed out.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Whatever meniscus volume remains after trimming is essential to slow down any rate of arthritis. Therefore, if it’s possible, you should have a nonrepairable meniscus trimmed in a technique called saucerization. In this technique, the edges of the meniscus are trimmed where necessary, while the portion of the meniscus that probably will not tear further and could still act as a cushion is retained.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Patients who have a meniscus repair may take longer to recover but often can get back to full activities with a better long-term prognosis. Patients who have a meniscus resected often return to activities much quicker but then will start to develop arthritis and have to decrease their activities over time. The takeaway on all this is that while it is easy to have your meniscus taken out, you’ll pay the consequences over the long term. Look at having a meniscus repair over having a meniscus taken out, if possible. Saving your meniscus can make a huge difference in your knee function over the long term.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Overall, MCL tears are two to three times more common than ACL tears (see here). MCL tears can occur when you’re twisting to the outside and your knee gives out, or when you get hit on the outside of the knee, such as a clipping injury while playing football, basketball, or soccer.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "John Hunter, a famous eighteenth-century English surgeon, reported in 1743 that once cartilage was injured, it never heals again. Unfortunately, that fact is still true today, and the holy grail of knee surgery is to figure out a way to truly repair cartilage as it was composed prior to the injury.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Early cartilage wear is called chondromalacia and is the beginning stages of arthritis. Sometimes with chondromalacia some pieces of the cartilage flip back (delamination) and can limit your function. If this is only in the top portion of the cartilage, and not all the way down, an arthroscopic procedure to trim out the damaged cartilage can be useful in improving your function.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "As there is no cure for arthritis, modifying your activities can allow your knee to function better over the long term, rather than paying the price with advancing amounts of arthritis. (Keep in mind that you may or may not feel pain with these injuries, as inflammation plays a huge role in this disease. And sometimes a trial of physical therapy can help improve your symptoms with muscular strengthening.) What happens if you keep doing high-impact activities anyway? Over time, the cartilage defect will worsen, and you will have more symptoms, such as pain and swelling with activities and an overall stiff joint. A full-thickness cartilage defect is similar to a pothole in a highway: when the cars drive over it, they slowly break down the edges, and the pothole keeps getting bigger and bigger.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "One of the main ways to treat cartilage lesions is called a chondroplasty. This involves taking a shaver and smoothing off the edges of the torn cartilage. In this circumstance, only the damaged edges of the cartilage that are catching are removed because if the deeper portions or edges of the cartilage are removed, it can never be restored. Chondroplasty can be effective in treating symptoms and is a mainstay of cartilage treatment for many patients who may have surface changes or larger flaps causing symptoms.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "A slightly higher-level technique to treat cartilage lesions is called a microfracture. In the microfracture technique, a small pick or drill is used to break through the bony layer that supports the cartilage. The theory behind this is that the stem cells (see here) deep within the bone will form a clot and ultimately lead to a sturdier fibrocartilage layer. The patient needs to be on crutches for a minimum of six weeks to not stress the clot and make it fall off, and so the trabecular bone can heal. Because the tissue has to grow and mature to be able to absorb some shock, most patients are not allowed to go back to any type of impact activities or any stressful activities for a minimum of six to nine months after a microfracture procedure.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "All in all, the best treatment for cartilage lesions is to avoid them at all costs. Preserving your meniscus tissue and avoiding any significant overloading of the knee joint is the best way to ensure that you keep your cartilage healthy. Remember, once cartilage is injured, it never heals with the same tissue, and all the treatments available still do not restore it to its normal state.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Every year 0.15 cartilage repair/restoration procedures are performed per 1,000 people, or approximately 50,000 cartilage repair/restoration procedures in a year in the United States.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "An arthroscopic chondroplasty debridement requires patients to be on crutches for two to seven days, and they can usually return to full activities within six to eight weeks. A microfracture procedure requires patients to be on crutches with no weight bearing for six to eight weeks and may take seven to nine months to return to activities. An osteochondral transfer from another area of the knee requires six weeks of minimal weight bearing to no weight bearing and four to six months of recovery. A fresh osteochondral allograft requires patients to be non–weight-bearing for up to eight weeks with partial weight bearing for an additional month, and they should avoid any impact activities until the bone sufficiently heals. This can take up to a year. When the right leg is affected, patients can usually drive at about the nine- to ten-week point after surgery.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Fractures of the tibial plateau can be quite serious because they involve the cartilage surfaces. (See Figure 3.14.) These fractures come in all shapes and sizes. In a Humpty Dumpty fracture, in which the pieces are small and fragmented, it can be difficult to put them together, and you can rapidly develop traumatic arthritis. Your doctor will need to assess the amount of displacement of the fracture (often part of the floor of the tibia will have a depression where the joint surface is offset, causing problems with cartilage erosion) and how extensive the fracture is to determine if you need surgery, or if you can go without surgery and use crutches for a period of time to let the fracture heal.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Nondisplaced tibial plateau fractures can almost always be treated with a period of immobilization or non–weight-bearing activity until they heal. These fractures usually have no or minimal offset of the cartilage surface at the fracture site, and if they heal correctly, there is typically little consequence in the short term. Over the long term, arthritis may still form. The best way to ensure that arthritis does not develop is to make sure that you exercise correctly and do not have a stiff knee.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "For displaced fractures, surgery is almost always a next step. In these circumstances, some type of fixation hardware is required to hold the fracture in place so that it heals in the correct position. When these fractures involve one surface with little fragmentation, the joint surface can usually be successfully restored. In cases of significant fragmentation, it may be almost impossible to get the joint surface back to normal, and the long-term prognosis can be grim. This is because the area is likely to develop arthritis; often the even normal-looking cartilage surfaces get so damaged that the cartilage cells themselves die over time, and this area also becomes arthritic.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "TIBIAL PLATEAU FRACTURE How common: 0.10 per 1,000 people per year, or approximately 35,000 affected people per year in the United States. Common causes: Motor vehicle accidents, skiing injuries, or a fall from heights. Average patient: A fifty-year-old female who falls while skiing. What to do: These injuries fall into the high-energy category. Urgent and emergency tibial plateau fractures need to be seen by a physician as soon as possible; x-rays will determine if there is a step-off (depression) at the joint line resulting from the fracture. If the x-ray isn’t clear, a CT scan can show how much bony offset is present.\\n\\nJune 27, 2021", "Because of the significant trauma associated with a knee dislocation, most patients will start to develop arthritis within ten years. This is probably a result of some of the cartilage cells being killed at the initial impact. Not a lot can be done about this, other than ensuring that the patient restores their muscle mass, so they have better shock absorption with everyday activities. Preserving the torn menisci is also essential; if the meniscus needs to be taken out, the risk of osteoarthritis will significantly increase.\\n\\nJune 29, 2021", "Another factor intricately related to all injuries is the dreaded he-who-must-not-be-name d of the musculoskeletal system: osteoarthritis. Arthritis is irreversible. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, and once you have it, this can lead to further problems down the road. Thus, it’s best to treat injuries to prevent arthritis or in a way that minimizes the risk of developing arthritis.\\n\\nJuly 1, 2021", "The most important structure to preserve as a line of defense against arthritis is the meniscus—keeping it is probably the best thing one can do to make sure the joint stays healthy. Taking the meniscus out always leads to arthritis developing later and to instability of the knee. The other factor for development of arthritis is time, which is why if we take a meniscus out of a young patient, they have a lot of time to develop arthritis, whereas removing a meniscus in an older patient is less detrimental.\\n\\nJuly 1, 202"]
