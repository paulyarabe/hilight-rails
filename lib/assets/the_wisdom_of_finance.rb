Even today, ships will declare general average, under the York-Antwerp Rules, and impose these costs on cargo holders. The practice of general average is a pooling of risk, which is the essence of insurance. Insurance binds people together by mutualizing risk: we’re all in this together. The pooling achieved by general average happens forcibly as a matter of maritime law rather than a voluntary insurance contract.\\n\\nJune 4, 2017", "what organization is best suited to pool risk and counter the effects of moral hazard and adverse selection?

For Peirce, if “chance itself pours in at every avenue of sense,” then it naturally followed that “all human affairs rest upon probabilities, and the same thing is true everywhere.” The first lesson from Peirce comes simply from the embrace of randomness.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "Once you embrace randomness, you are left with the task of making sense of the world and seeking out the patterns that can guide your behavior. That leads us to probabilities as the only way to really understand the world—nothing is entirely certain and we should approach the world probabilistically. If we want to understand how probable things are and how the world works, the only way to figure out these probabilities is through experience, just as with an insurance company. The more experience an insurance company has with a population, the better their understanding of probabilities and the more successful their business.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "That’s why, in effect, we’re all insurance companies—experience is the critical method for understanding how to thrive. Peirce’s emphasis on insurance was a natural extension of his philosophy of pragmatism. Pragmatism is the opposite of navel-gazing; in pragmatism, truths are only valuable to the degree they can inform actions, and actions are only valuable if they confirm a truth. Peirce often talks about experience with the statistical term “sampling.” Only by sampling what the universe has to offer can we learn anything of value. We should experience as much as possible—just as insurance companies must—in order to make good decisions and understand the world with the right probabilities.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "Death makes the number of our risks, of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain.

They must not stop at our own fate, but must embrace the whole community. This community, again, must not be limited, but must extend to all races of beings with whom we can come into immediate or mediate intellectual relation. It must reach, however vaguely beyond this geological epoch, beyond all bounds...Logic is rooted in the social principle. To be logical, men should not be selfish. If our own experiences are inherently limited, understanding the world requires incorporating the experiences and welfare of others. Reacting against the idea of social Darwinism, Peirce instead thought that the logic of insurance and sampling inexorably led to “that famous trio of Charity, Faith and Hope, which, in the estimation of St. Paul, are the finest and greatest of spiritual gifts.” We must embrace others to understand the world—the imperative of experience gathering demands it. For Peirce, insurance teaches us that experience and empathy are the key methods for dealing with the chaos of the world.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "For Peirce, insurance became the central metaphor for explaining that and describing how to handle it—through experience, pragmatism, and empathy. For Stevens, a man who spent his life negotiating insurance claims rather than dedicating himself uniquely to poetry, imagination was the central tool for managing the omnipresence of chaos and for seeking and seeing the hidden order of things amid the chaos. It is no wonder that Stevens concluded that “poetry and surety claims aren’t as unlikely a combination as they may seem.”\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "Insurance, as we saw, is a powerful tool for managing the risks of mortality, longevity, or natural disasters.

In financial parlance, this is tantamount to creating a portfolio of options and then choosing to invest in one asset at the opportune time. The portfolio of options allows you to wait until you are ready to invest and to see how these assets are evolving—far preferable to committing to one asset prematurely or waiting in the hopes that the “right” asset will come along eventually\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "People in finance love options for the freedom and opportunity they represent. And they frame much of their life in analogous terms. By pursuing education, for example, they increase “option value” because more degrees and networks mean that more choices will be available to them.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "This transaction is the essence of an options transaction—relatively small premia are paid to secure the rights to enter into transactions rather than obligating someone to do something, thereby enabling them to access resources they might need but don’t know if they will need.

Because an option is a right and not an obligation, you don’t have to purchase assets if they decline, but you can still enjoy the possibility of price increases—this characteristic makes it a powerful speculative tool.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "In part, people in finance love options because of the nature of this asymmetric payoff. Losses are contained and gains are unlimited. And experiences that create optionality—educational experiences, for example—are valued precisely because of the asymmetric nature of the payoffs.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "Purchasing options allows us to wish for outcomes and allows us to imagine what is possible and what might come true. This link between options and the desire to explore what is possible is precisely why Ralph Waldo Emerson called America “optative”—options are for people who want to imagine the outcomes that they desire.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "The most distinctive aspect of options is how their asymmetric nature makes them particularly valuable when environments become more risky. Because you have little to lose and much to gain, events that make outcomes more extreme are welcome. In other words, options, because they are a form of insurance, are more valuable when life becomes even more uncertain. By implication, if you hold an option, you will be encouraged to undertake riskier adventures. So, the real payoff from having options is the risk-taking that it enables. This is particularly evident when you come to realize suddenly that you hold an option.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "Acquiring options can help you assess a set of outcomes beyond your current capabilities, allow you to take more risks than you would otherwise, and simultaneously protect you when you stumble.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "I am no longer surprised to see students who end up remaining in companies—usually consulting or investment banking firms—that were initially intended as way stations that would create more optionality on the path to their actual entrepreneurial, social, or political goals. They often end up saying to themselves, “Why not stay another year and create more options for down the road?” The tool that was supposed to lead to more risk-taking ends up preventing it. Any commitment necessarily must overcome the loss of option value that choices close off. So, commitments of various kinds become difficult given the extra burden they bear. It is not uncommon to hear people in finance talk about marriage as the death of optionality. Implicitly, the act of marriage is characterized as the loss of something—future choices—rather than the beginning of something. As a result, a focus on the creation and preservation of choices can ironically lead to an inability to make choices\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "sometimes, the prospect of multiple outcomes is so tantalizing that we resist actually making a decision, preferring to live in a world of possibilities. This is what Bartleby does—preferring potentiality over reality, preferring optionality over real decisions\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "This logic of diversification is the cornerstone of portfolio theory and represents the only true “free lunch” in finance. It’s also a logic with a long history as a risk management strategy. The earliest examples, like those of insurance, date back to early shipping where cargo would be divided among ships and routes to mitigate the risks of a loss.\\n\\nJune 5, 2017", "The key insight from finance is that diversification of the type recommended in these religious texts not only reduces risks but can actually preserve returns. What could be better than similar returns with less risk? By investing in assets that perform differently, we can benefit from the imperfect relationship between assets. In fact, the best kinds of assets are those that behave very differently from the assets you already own—such assets, when included in your portfolio, reduce risk and can preserve returns. And assets that perform much like what we already own are of limited use for diversification purposes.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "The finance take on this is that diversifying\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "our experiences and relationships is precisely what we should be doing—relationships don’t crowd each other out but they enrich each other. Being a good friend and colleague doesn’t diminish your efforts as a parent but may well benefit those efforts. In fact, the relationships that are most enriching are ones that broaden our perspective beyond our usual experience—those relationships are, in finance terms, “imperfectly correlated assets,” precisely the types of assets that most enhance the portfolios of our lives. Similarly, filling our lives with only those people who think like we do and who experience the same world that we inhabit is not nearly as powerful. Just as Keynes found it hard to intuit diversification, the logic of a diversified portfolio of relationships runs counter to many of our instincts. Homophily, or the desire to surround ourselves with like-minded people, is a common social instinct—and one that finance warns against. Yes, it’s easier to be around like-minded types, but finance recommends the hard work of exposing yourself to differences, not shielding yourself from them\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "So, here’s what that model boils down to: assets that fluctuate very much along with your portfolio are “high-beta” assets that are not highly valued because of their limited diversification value. In fact, they make your exposure to the market even more pronounced—when the market goes down, these stocks go down a lot. The low values of these high-beta assets are the result of the high returns you expect from those assets—since they don’t provide much diversification value, they’d better be associated with high returns. And here’s the most elusive part of that finance logic—if you need high returns from assets, that can only be accomplished by giving them lower prices today. Lower prices for a given stream of cash flows create the higher returns you need to compensate you for the risk presented by these high-beta stocks.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "\"Low-beta” assets, in contrast, move with your portfolio but just not as much, so they don’t need to generate as high returns and, therefore, have higher prices. As you may already surmise, betas are simply shorthand for the correlation of an asset with your portfolio. At the other extreme, “negative-beta” assets move in the opposite direction of your portfolio—when your whole portfolio does well, these negative-beta assets do poorly, and when your whole portfolio tanks, these stocks do very well.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "And for that reason these assets (low beta assets) are very valuable. Their high value comes from the low expected returns you require of them; that is, since they provide such effective insurance, they don’t need to give you explicit returns. In fact, such assets can be associated with negative expected returns precisely because they do such a good job of performing well when the rest of your portfolio is a disaster. It all goes back to the principles of insurance. Assets that provide insurance—by paying off when the rest of your assets do poorly—are very valuable, and you will pay dearly for them. And assets that exacerbate the risks you face in the rest of your portfolio are not highly valued and need to earn a high return to compensate you for all that additional risk exposure.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "So, who are the high-beta, low-beta, and negative-beta assets in your life? The high-beta assets in your life are likely your LinkedIn network or professional acquaintances. These relationships are largely instrumental; in other words, these individuals are likely to show up when you do well and disappear when things go poorly. Accordingly, they should be given low values—it’s not that they can’t be a source of great benefits; it’s just that they compound the risks you face and don’t provide much insurance. When you’re down on your knees, these assets provide no relief. Low-beta assets are considerably more valuable—they are the steady friends who are there for you no matter what happens to you. In fact, this classification of friendships closely mirrors the taxonomy of friendships provided by Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics . The lowest form of friendship, for Aristotle, is the high-beta, transactional friendship where individuals “love each other for their utility” and “do not love each other for themselves but in virtue of some good which they get from each other.” These are friendships that are thin and fragile as “if one party is no longer pleasant or useful the other ceases to love him.” When you’re succeeding, these high-beta friends surface, but they disappear when you stumble because you become less valuable to them. The much higher notion of friendship is the low-beta friendship where good individuals wish each other well without qualification based on the goodness that these friends feel toward them.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "But Aristotle reserves his highest praise for the love that is unconditional—the negative-beta assets in your life. When you stumble the hardest, these people are there for you the most—and when you fly too high, they manage to pull you back down to earth. Noting that “most people seem...to wish to be loved rather than love,” Aristotle contrasts that typical sentiment with mothers who “take delight in loving” and “they themselves love their children even if these owing to their ignorance give them nothing of a mother’s due.” That sounds just like the negative returns we are willing to live with for negative-beta assets. When we love our negative-beta assets unconditionally—we give and give and give and expect nothing in return—that’s negative expected\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "In finance, we are trying to figure out how to invest our assets and manage toward the best risk-return tradeoff. In life, we are trying to figure out how to allocate our time and energies across many people. It also matches because the underlying logic of insurance is present in both settings. For me, this parallel prompted several questions: Am I providing insurance to my loved ones and friends? Am I there when they need me the most? Am I dedicating too much time to the high-beta assets in my portfolio rather than realizing that they are relatively low-value relationships? And am I valuing the negative-beta assets in my life appropriately?\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "Ultimately, she realizes that Darcy is not working against her sisters’ interests but is actually a reliable ally.

With risks investigated and returns well established, Lizzy gets a second bite at the apple as Darcy presents the option yet again, and now Lizzy doesn’t hesitate. Instead of thinking of how much the loss of optionality would cost her, she “hits the bid.” She seems to have understood that risk management is not a goal in and of itself—but rather a set of strategies to ensure that one can take the big bets one needs to take to truly create value.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", ".

We are the stewards of those gifts and must make the most of them. At some point, we’ll all be held accountable for what we do with our gifts, and living in fear and depriving yourself and the world of your gifts is sinful.

He explicitly linked the parable to finance in a sermon titled “The Use of Money.” The latter two parts of the sermon are summarized as “Do not throw the precious talent into the sea” and “Having, First, gained all you can, and, Secondly saved all you can, Then give all you can.” This quote is in fact the origin of the more popular framing of Wesley’s logic: “Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can.” It is difficult to summarize the financial logic of value creation any better.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "Finance’s starting point in valuation is that previous accomplishments and what you have to day bear little relationship to real value. Finance is completely and ruthlessly forward-looking. The only source of value today is the future. The first step of valuation is to look forward and project what a company or investment will produce in the future\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "If you look at any valuation model used in finance, it has that basic structure. Ignore the past and present. Look forward to the future and project economic returns. Translate those back to today’s value using a “weighted average cost of capital”—a blend of the returns expected by your debt and equity financing. That translation gives you what something is worth today—and if it’s more than what you have to pay for the asset, you have a good deal. Valuing an investment in education has the same structure—project forward the extra wages you will earn because of that education, translate those incremental wages back to today, and compare them to the tuition. If the translated future values are greater than the tuition, you have a good investment.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "Finance’s approach to valuation is as harsh as the logic of value creation. Whatever you’ve done in the past doesn’t matter and the only thing that matters is the future—and the longer you make me wait for my returns in that future, the greater the punishment via discounting. All value accrues from the future. In fact, any finance practitioner knows that standard valuation models result in the vast majority of value being attributed to so-called terminal values. The value of companies like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter hinges on whatever assumptions we make about what they will do far off in the future—and these assumptions are captured in what people call terminal values. In short, though we project what they’ll do in the next several years, the majority of their value is going to come from whatever we think they’ll do well down the road.\\n\\nJune 6, 2017", "First, ruthlessly look forward and ignore the past and present in deciding what value is and what actions to undertake. Your previous accomplishments and missed opportunities mean nothing when looking at yourself today. Second, this emphasis on the future means that all estimates of value and decision making are acts of imagination and fundamentally conjectural. Imagining alternative futures is critical for making good decisions, just as it is for valuing investments. Finally, most value arises from terminal values (reflecting returns into perpetuity) and not returns in the short run. We are in a long game, and most enduring value arises from what we leave behind—our legacies—and not what we enjoy while we’re here. I recall my father often telling me something that I now tell my daughters (my terminal values)—“the world belongs to the young.” This is an adaptation of a Mao Zedong quote, but the sentiment permeates many traditions and it is an encapsulation of the logic of finance. We are in service of future generations, for it is their world much more than ours.\\n\\nJune 7, 2017", "Levet was a poor man to whom Johnson gave shelter and Levet became a caretaker of sorts for those around him. While in many ways a completely unremarkable man, Levet was worthy of the highest praise from Johnson: “obscurely wise, and coarsely kind,” an individual who, through the care and affection he gave those around him, demonstrated “the power of art without the show.” Why did Levet deserve such praise? Johnson invokes the parable when he concludes: His virtues walk’d their narrow round, Nor made a pause, nor left a void; And sure th’ Eternal Master found The single talent well employ’d. Johnson, a man blessed with innumerable talents, took inspiration from a man with little material wealth or natural ability, but with the sole talent of providing care and affection to those around him. For Johnson, the parable is not a recipe for worshipping the “great men and women” of the world who have been given much, but rather a lesson in humility and a reason to appreciate the contributions of those who provide so much despite not being endowed as richly as he was.\\n\\nJune 7, 2017", "beta is a measure of how a stock moves with the market. And that co-movement with the market is the risk that investors can’t diversify away and must bear, and therefore demand compensation for. So money managers who get paid for providing returns that are just associated with bearing that risk are doing nothing of value. According to the logic of valuation, they are not creating value. Yet, they are still being compensated handsomely—they are being paid for beta. Returning to our previous example, they are just meeting expectations, yet they think they’re creating value. In contrast to this freeloading logic, “alpha” represents value creation—these are the returns above and beyond expected returns. In short, alpha generators have reached finance nirvana. You are truly generating value, beyond any returns expected for risks borne, when you generate alpha. The mistake people in finance make all too often is reflected in their appreciation of the more challenging parts of the parable of the talents. They attribute much of their success and returns simply to alpha generation and they pride themselves on it. In reality, finance teaches us that it is very difficult to know the extent to which our efforts are responsible for generating alpha.\\n\\nJune 7, 2017", "First, there is the nature of randomness that will make any measure of success unreliable.

Smith had applied a “stamp of indiscriminate reprobation” upon “all such persons as, in the pursuit of wealth, strike out into any new channel, and particularly, into any new channel of invention” in favor of those “whose trade runs in the old channels, and to the best security which such channels can afford.” Outlawing high interest rates and demeaning borrowing prevented innovation and growth, was inconsistent with liberty, and was unnecessary since lenders could take care of themselves.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "So how much leverage should a company take on? The simplest finance answer for firms is that they trade off two contrary impulses—the tax advantages of using debt versus the risk that debt imposes on organizations. Because interest payments are tax deductible for firms and individuals, it can be advantageous to use debt. In short, by taking on debt to finance equipment purchases or a home for an individual, you are allowed by the government to pay less in taxes and to shift value from the government to yourself.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "Much of what life has to offer requires the help of others. Being married, starting a family, engaging in meaningful friendships, working in organizations, starting a business are all value-generating activities that one simply can’t do alone. Getting that help creates a set of commitments—and those commitments come with constraints. In short, how you are able to embed yourself in broader networks and relationships through commitments will determine your ultimate trajectory—much as debt shapes the trajectories of firms by providing resources in return for commitments.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "Successful entrepreneurs are Orwells who must become more like a Koons. Ideas may germinate in your head, but creating a business out of them will certainly require innumerable interdependencies\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "What kinds of mistakes do people make in levering their lives? Most obviously, they can take on too many commitments and obligations and may not be able to live up to those obligations. We’ll return to that in the following chapter when we talk about financial distress and bankruptcy. But what mistake do people make on average ? One of the central facts about corporations and their financing decisions maps particularly well to our lives. By most measures, firms are dramatically underlevered. They don’t appear to take the full advantages that the tradeoff theory implies and, as a result, remain underlevered. Many individuals may well do the same thing—they retreat from commitments and obligations, and in the process, they limit what they can do. Studies of regret show that regret mostly arises from commitments avoided—untaken educational opportunities, missed love connections, and inattention to children.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "Is leverage just a benevolent tool to help you achieve your dreams? Is it all just that simple? Anyone who’s labored under the weight of loans can attest to the difficulties leverage can create. The pressure of student loans and mortgages can change the shape of our lives. The commitments of leverage can even preclude you from pursuing the dreams you might have otherwise pursued—mired in student debt, you may ask yourself if you can take on additional commitments to pursue those dreams. That problem is known by the ominous name of “debt overhang.” The idea of debt overhang is that you can prevent yourself from doing things you should do because of the shadow of a preexisting commitment.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "The logic of the leverage bonus extends further. By embedding yourself in demanding relationships and making commitments, you may well just become a better person. In offering advice to young people, Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, said, “Don’t make friends who are comfortable to be with. Make friends who will force you to lever yourself up.” Commitments to smart and demanding people keep us from doing stupid things—we gain from those commitments. Leverage is not a zero-sum game.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "In addition to allowing you to be more productive and raising your own standards, embedding yourself in meaningful relationships is simply good for you.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "and physical development by continuing the so-called Grant Study of Harvard undergraduates in the late 1930s. By tracking physiological and emotional data over more than seventy years, Vaillant and his colleagues provide some of the best evidence on what matters for longevity and happiness. And the answer he arrived at, as described by Joshua Wolf Shenk, is deceptively simple. Vaillant’s other main interest is the power of relationships. “It is social aptitude,” he writes, “not intellectual brilliance or parental social class, that leads to successful aging.” Warm connections are necessary—and if not found in a mother or father, they can come from siblings, uncles, friends, mentors. The men’s relationships at age 47, he found, predicted late-life adjustment better than any other variable, except defenses [mechanisms for reacting to adversity]. Good sibling relationships seem especially powerful: 93 percent of the men who were thriving at age 65 had been close to a brother or sister when younger.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "\"That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.”\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "the “discipline of the market” shrouds all of finance in a meritocratic haze. Investors come to see their outcomes as reflecting their ability, given the chaotic, competitive market they work in, rather than acknowledging the dominant role of chance.\\n\\nJune 15, 2017"]
