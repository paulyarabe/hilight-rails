Most of them are about starting businesses. Many are about the challenges entrepreneurs face. Some are about what is involved in running a business. Others are about life in general. So rather than write a book, I decided to aggregate, curate (see how I used current buzzwords right there?) and update some of my more popular and personal blog posts from the past seven years. As you go through this collection, don’t feel you have to read it like a book. Use it as a way to get fired up. A way to get motivated. Something you can go back to when you need it.

If you fail, get back up and go for it again. I have been fired from more jobs than most people have had! In the search for success, you can fail any number of times, but you only have to get it right one time.\\n\\nDecember 30, 2015", "Everyone has inside of them what it takes to be successful. You just have to be ready to unleash it when the opportunity presents itself.\\n\\nDecember 30, 2015", "8. Everyone gets down; the key is how soon you get back up I can’t count how many times I have gotten up in the morning dreading the day. I wasn’t motivated. I was tired. I just wanted to crawl back in bed. Other times, I had lost a deal, we had lost a game, something wasn’t working. I just wanted to crawl under a rock and disappear. EVERYONE goes through those moments. The key is how you fight through them. The people who will be truly successful are those that fight through the quickest and come back stronger and smarter.\\n\\nDecember 30, 2015", "10. It’s not in the dreaming, it’s in the doing Everyone has it in them to be successful. EVERYONE. Most people only dream about what they do if they were successful, or how they might get there. Anyone can dream. Anyone and everyone has ideas about how they might be successful. It doesn’t matter if your definition of success is being a great parent, being an athlete, a business person, whatever. When I catch myself daydreaming about how I’m going to do this or that, I always try to wake up and ask myself just how I’m going to get from where I am to where I want to be. What EXACTLY is it going to take to DO it, rather than dream about it.\\n\\nDecember 30, 2015", "As I’ve said, I have been fired from more jobs than most people have had. Some jobs I have had were so bad, the only way I could justify them to myself was that I was getting paid to learn (as opposed to paying to go to school). I have started a stupid business that was doomed to fail (selling powdered milk). I have dated more girls that I wanted to. The beauty of success, whether it’s finding the girl of your dreams, the right job or financial success, is that it doesn’t matter how many times you have failed, you only have to be right once. No one keeps score. There are so many ways that each of us can find happiness and success in our endeavors, that it never really matters how many times you fail. You only have to be right once.\\n\\nDecember 30, 2015"]
