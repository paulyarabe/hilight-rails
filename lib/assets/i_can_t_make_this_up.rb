book_notes = ["It’s easy to complain about your life—how tough it is, how unfair it is, how stressful it is, how everyone else has it much better. But if you step into the life of someone you envy for just a day, you’ll discover that everyone has their own problems, and they’re usually worse than yours. Be cause your problems are designed specifically for you, with the specific purpose of helping you grow.\\n\\nJuly 6, 2017", "Most of the star athletes in school had no personality. Hanging out with them wasn’t a good time. Because I didn’t take myself and life so seriously, girls started to hang around me more. And that’s when I realized: The fun guy always wins. This is because no matter where you are or what you’re doing, if you’re with the fun guy, you’re gonna have a good time. You could be sitting in an empty room watching television with the fun guy, and it could be one of the best nights of your life. You could go out for a cup of coffee with the fun guy and end up laughing more in one hour than you have all year. Even if you’re doing your laundry with the fun guy, you’re gonna have a great time because he knows the secret to life. You want to know what that secret is? It’s two words: Have fun. You can close this book now. Thank you for reading. Good night.\\n\\nJuly 6, 2017", "July 6, 2017", "Your friends may love you, but the problem is that they love you as you are. You play a role in their lives that they’ve gotten used to, so they don’t always want you to change. Most of them think their job is to keep you humble and in your place. As for the person you’re dating, he or she may support you or not. It depends on a few variables: how good the relationship is, how old the relationship is, how your last plan turned out, and whether this change will bring you closer to or further away from that person. Fortunately, my relationship with Torrei was new and I had a good track record with her, so she was supportive. “I think you’re funny. You can do this.” Those few words meant a lot.\\n\\nJuly 8, 2017", "In the days that followed, I tested out jokes on my coworkers and customers. I practiced every night on my roommate. Everything became a joke or a potential joke. If I burnt food I was cooking, I’d say, “Yo, I just burnt the food. Uh, I got food burn. I shoulda put suntan lotion on.” Paul would smile politely, and I’d ask, “That was a funny joke, right? You think that’s a funny joke?” My pocket was full of paper scraps with joke ideas I’d written on them. If I ran into a friend, I’d pull out a scrap and say, “Tell me if you think this is funny.”\\n\\nJuly 8, 2017", "Fortunately, my friends continued to “encourage” me: Paul: I don’t think that’s funny, man. Spank: That ain’t gonna work, Kev. Zachary: You sure you wanna do this, man? Even Kenneth: Hey, you’re my little brother and I love you. So whatever you do, I’m gonna back you. But I don’t know, man. I just don’t think this is your thing.\\n\\nJuly 8, 2017", "Here are some of the things people might say to you when you decide to pursue your dream: “I know you’re excited about this right now, but you can’t make a living at it.” “Are you sure this is what you want to do? Take some time and really think about it.” “Don’t quit your day job.” “Stop dreaming.” “Be realistic.” “There’s no money in it.” “It’s not a smart choice.” “There’s too much competition.” “You’re not good enough.” Many people will tell you to ignore these doubters. Others will tell you to listen and then prove them wrong, which worked for me in those first shows. But I’m going to recommend something better that I learned much later: Don’t invite them into the conversation. You already know what you want to dedicate yourself to, so you don’t need to ask for their approval. There’s no need to seek external approval when you already have internal approval.\\n\\nJuly 8, 2017", "As I grew more comfortable with the character, people on the scene started to notice. “Man, the new guy’s getting good. This kid got potential.” They weren’t saying this because I was a great comedian, or even a good one. They were saying it because I was persistent, and that persistence was starting to show up in small improvements. When you’re trying to make it, you’re not judged necessarily by your talent but by your potential. And that potential is all about your willingness to listen, learn, and improve\\n\\nJuly 8, 2017", "However, you want to have a relationship with the audience, and the name you were born with is going to have more depth and authenticity than a character you made up.”\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "“Yeah,” I sighed. On an intuitive level, I knew that he was right. But I didn’t want to start all over as Kevin Hart and throw away the work I’d done so far. “I can see the doubt in your eyes.” Keith grew more impassioned, leaning in a little too close. “Stop being a dummy. Your job as a person with talent is to make yourself interesting after the audience hears your name. Define the person who was just introduced.” “How do you do that?” “It’s simple, stupid. You be yourself. When they say Kevin Hart, your first words should be ‘Hey, what’s going on? My name is Kevin Hart. I’m happy to be here.’ ” It felt like he’d just told me to pull down my pants and take a crap on stage. In fact, taking an on-stage shit would have made more sense to me. At least that was interesting and memorable. Starting out by greeting the audience like I was at a job interview made absolutely no sense. But I was willing to try it again. “Oh, man. I can do that, I guess.” “It’s a long journey to finding yourself. Just go on that journey. It’s worth it.”\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "It’s not about you getting on stage, stupid. It’s about you seeing what’s out there. This is the world where you need to be if you wanna make it. I could easily get you guys into these clubs, but I’m not using my good name to help nobody that’s not serious and not making this a number one priority.” “We’re serious. We just think we should have had the chance to get up.” “Shut up about the get up. Get serious about learning. They spit on me for years before I could even think of getting up somewhere.” I relented. “Okay, okay. We’re serious about learning.” “Then keep rolling with me, and everything will fall into place.”\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "The main thing is to come from the heart,” he went on. “Say something that matters, rather than stuff you think the crowd wants to hear, and you won’t go wrong—even if it doesn’t go over well.\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "“But what should I do to make that stuff funny without pandering?” “Just tell the truth, then work your way to funny from there. When you let them in on what’s really going on with you, you’ll automatically find the jokes in your life.” “What’s an example of someone who does that?” “Look at Richard Pryor. That’s why he’s still unanimously the number one comic. Sometimes life is brutal, and he isn’t afraid to come out with his truth and say it. And when he changes his mind about things, he isn’t afraid to tell people he doesn’t feel the same way anymore. Just speak what you know, dummy. I lived in the projects back in 1980, but they’re not the same now. So I don’t speak about them and pretend like I know what it’s like to grow up there today.”\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "Wanda turned and spoke to me directly for the first time: “Well, shut up and listen, stupid. He knows what he’s talking about.” As we made the usual circuit, Keith encouraged me to notice details that I’d previously overlooked. “You really are a dummy. You’ve been coming up here all these weeks and missing the whole point. All these people are coming up, and what? They got a piece of paper in their hand and they got a tape recorder on the stool.” “I noticed that. They’re working to get better.” “No, young fella! These guys are working for the weekend. On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, they’re preparing for the big shows on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. That’s where your packed houses are. Until then, everybody’s try ing to polish their set for the weekend. And they’re trying to polish their weekend sets so they can get TV spots. And they’re trying to kill their TV spots so they can get their own television show. If you stay ready, you don’t ever have to worry about getting ready.”\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "A firm “no” is the ugliest sound in the world, and it triggers a defensive response in the brain: “Naw, you’re wrong!” But he was right: I wasn’t ready. I still knew nothing about the art of comedy. The problem was not Keith’s slowness. It was my impatience. I recognized that I had a lot of work to do to get to that level. Instead of thinking about getting on stage in New York, I needed to think about removing, rewriting, reconstructing, shifting, and shaping every phrase in my set, examining every nuance from my tonality to my gestures.\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "In life, some people can cut through the noise and get through to you in a way that others can’t. If you’re playing sports, one coach may not reach you, but another will. Or no coach may be able to get through to you, but a teammate will. When it comes to your future, your mother may be telling you exactly what you need to hear but putting it in a way that makes you disregard her. However, Calvin from two doors down the street says the same thing, and it comes off as so simple and helpful that you pay attention and take action.\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "Cultivating the ability to listen to advice I didn’t want to hear, objectively evaluate it, and know when to implement it didn’t come naturally to me. I had to learn it the hard way, from someone who was very difficult to listen to. It was one of the most valuable gifts Keith gave me.\\n\\nJuly 9, 2017", "I often speak about the value of hard work, but hard work is not enough. I’ve seen many people sabotage their career before it’s even started by refusing to do anything unless they’re compensated or rewarded directly for it. Or they become bitter, expecting that they’ll be rewarded in exchange for just working hard.\\n\\nJuly 10, 2017", "One of the key factors for success—beyond work, talent, timing, relationships, and all the other qualities I’ve mentioned—is the glue that holds all of these together: commitment. What is commitment? Here’s what it means to me: keeping the promises you make to yourself and to others. I promised my mother I’d figure out a way to survive in comedy. I promised myself I’d find a road out of Philadelphia and on to bigger opportunities. I promised Keith I’d trust him and stick with the process. All three of these promises turned out to be much harder, and take much longer to keep, than I’d expected. I still wasn’t surviving on my own. I still wasn’t getting big opportunities. I still wasn’t done with Keith’s mentorship. I was still spending more than thirty hours a week getting to and from and around New York just for that five minutes on stage on Sundays. Though my sleep, time, finances, relationship, and even my patience and self-esteem were negatively impacted and I wanted to quit many times, I remained committed. That’s the biggest difference between the amateur and the professional, between the wannabe and the star, between the dabbler and the expert. The unsuccessful get halfway to the finish line, then turn around. The successful get halfway, then keep going. Both run the same distance, but only one makes it to the finish line.\\n\\nJuly 10, 2017", "To commit successfully, you don’t have to always believe in yourself—because, let’s face it, we all have our doubts at times. But you do have to believe in something higher than yourself: your purpose. If you believe in your purpose, you can survive the most challenging times, because God or destiny or your will—or whatever you prefer to believe in—is on your side. If you know it’s your purpose to win the race, then you’re not going to turn around, because there is no other option but to win.\\n\\nJuly 10, 2017", "Look,” Keith explained. “You have people who understand what you’re doing right away, and you got people who won’t get it until everyone else does. That’s just the way it is. To succeed, you have to see how good you’re capable of becoming before anybody else sees it. I’m one of those people that see it, and that’s all you need: just a couple people backing you who believe in you.”\\n\\nJuly 10, 2017", "“It ain’t gonna happen overnight,” Keith went on. “It takes time. So until it happens, don’t fucking bitch about it. Be a man. Have a man’s intuition about taking care of business and go do what you’re supposed to do, which is work on your shit.” “Goddammit, you’re right,” I finally said. If it weren’t for the talk I had with Keith in the car that night, I don’t know what I would have done. I might have given up, at least for a little while. But instead, I kept going back to New York and working harder. I was eventually booked at every other club in the city, but I never went back to the Comic Strip.\\n\\nJuly 10, 2017", "The only thing that changed after the meeting was that every week or two, Dave would call to check in and ask how things were going. It was nice to have someone whose job it was to care. So I kept hustling and booking those rooms. “Do you have any spots?” “Can I do your room?” “How do I get an audition?” “Can I start a night here?” More often than not, I eventually got those spots, those rooms, those auditions, and those nights, until I was going to New York every day. I was successful not because I was the most talented person they’d seen and not even because I was the most persistent person they’d seen; I have no doubt that there were people more talented, more persistent, and harder working than me. But there was one other thing that gave me the winning edge, and will always give you the winning edge: being likeable. No person succeeds alone. Success is a community effort. The more relationships you have, the better you’ll be able to survive, thrive, and grow. A lot of times, I’ve seen people booked for parts on TV shows and films who weren’t the best actors, but everyone liked them, was treated well by them, and knew they’d enjoy having them on set.\\n\\nJuly 10, 2017", "In most action movies, one person rises out of a humble beginning to discover that they have been chosen by destiny to save the world. But that’s not how it works in real life. You rise out of your humble beginning to become part of a community, and it is only together and as equals that we will save the world.\\n\\nJuly 10, 2017", "For all his tough love and shit talk, Keith has a great big heart and was a true father figure to me during this time. To this day, I continue to ask him for advice about everything. In many ways, I owe my career to him, beyond just the guidance and opportunities he gave me. If he hadn’t been taking me to New York almost every day, I might have been in prison. Recently, I learned that those rides to New York were just as powerful for him. His mom was sick, and calling me “dummy” for a few hours each day helped him survive that time. A good mentor learns as much from teaching as the apprentice does from learning.\\n\\nJuly 11, 2017", "But it is funny. Problems are funny. You think you’re the only one in the world that’s going through relationship problems, dummy? How many guys will breathe a sigh of relief if they can look at their woman during your set and say, ‘See, we ain’t the only ones who get like that. There’s other couples that’s crazy too.’ ” The problems in my relationship felt like something I should be hiding, not talking about. But the truth was, Torrei was one of the only things I was qualified to talk about, besides sneakers. People call this the elusive obvious: It’s right there in front of your face\\n\\nJuly 12, 2017", "it was real and it was true, so it had an integrity and believability that the other story didn’t. I understood then what Keith had meant about the audience needing to know who I was. All along, I’d been trying to write jokes. This was another level: I was finding my pain points and transforming them into something that could touch and maybe even help other people. An entertainer makes you laugh, I realized, but an artist makes you understand.\\n\\nJuly 12, 2017", "That night led to perhaps the biggest epiphany of my career: The audi ence wasn’t laughing at the jokes. There weren’t really any punch lines. The situation itself might have been funny, since it was a role reversal, but it wasn’t that funny. What they were laughing at was my reactions. The humor was in my uniqueness, my personality—not the way I saw life, but the way I did life. That was the payoff; that’s where I struck gold. For the first time, I could see it wasn’t my jokes or my delivery or my ideas that were funny. I was actually funny\\n\\nJuly 12, 2017", "If you wait for certainty, you will spend your whole life standing still. And if you grow discouraged and give up when things get rough, you’ll miss out on your best possible destiny. So the secret is to be excited about what is in your power to control, be accepting of what’s not in your power to control, and then move with certainty into an uncertain future.\\n\\nJuly 12, 2017", "This of course leaves open the question of what direction you should move in. The answer: Pay attention, dummy. Life is pulling you there automatically. You don’t have to know. You don’t have to understand. You just have to trust. There is a flow to life, and all you have to do is make the decision to follow that current—even if it seems to be carrying you away from everyone around you. That’s why I made my next decision quickly and without a second thought, even though it was the biggest decision I’d ever made. I decided to move to the place where the current was pushing me: Hollywood. I told Torrei that if she wanted to move with me, I’d get everything set up so we could live together. Though we’d had such rough times in Philadelphia, I couldn’t imagine not being with her. She was my rock—although at times, a very loud rock. And every now and then, that rock hit you in the head. But we still loved each other in our crazy way. A relationship is strengthened not by experiencing good times together but by surviving the bad times.\\n\\nJuly 12, 2017", "Though people say to live in the moment, each moment leads to other moments. So treat each moment like a seed, and care for it so that something beautiful can grow from it. That Ray kid you joked around with when he was just starting out may become a studio head ten years later, and will remember that you noticed him and treated him special.\\n\\nJuly 12, 2017", "Life is not about the result—we all have the same outcome in the end. Life is about the effort you put into it. And I wasn’t putting effort into my craft anymore. After months of spiraling debt, domestic disputes, and career rejection, it was time to take a hard right turn and start doing the work myself. Fuck being someone else’s plus-one at the same clubs every night. Fuck calling Dave Becky every day, hoping that some executive saw something special in me. Fuck paying sixty-five dollars an hour that I can’t afford for an acting teacher when I’m not getting booked for anything. Fuck living a lie with Torrei and having the same argument over and over. Fuck all this idle time. It was time to get out of this city, take my career back into my own hands, and get on my grind again.\\n\\nJuly 13, 2017", "It was more proof that only your mother thinks you’re special; to all other people, you look the same as everyone else unless you make the effort to stand out—and that effort is always worth it. I kept the bunny and took it home as a reminder of this lesson.\\n\\nJuly 13, 2017", "I’ve learned so many valuable lessons in my life, and this was one of the most important: Do your best, always. Because you never know who’s watching. As Curtis Mayfield once said, “It may not come when you want it to, but when it does, it’s right on time.”\\n\\nJuly 17, 2017", "But the deeper lesson is that what’s important in a relationship is the bricks that every one of your words and actions lay down, because together they add up to the home that you’re going to live in for quite some time.\\n\\nJuly 17, 2017", "I started popping up for unscheduled spots in the New York clubs where I’d cut my teeth so I could test different stories and approaches. Some nights, there were only ten people in the audience. Other nights, I’d do thirty minutes and I wouldn’t hear a single laugh. A few times, I saw people on their phones when I was in the middle of talking about my mom’s funeral. But I needed to bomb to succeed: I knew that if I could find a way to win over audiences in these tough, cold rooms, then I’d have no problem in a theater packed with people who were actually there to see me. Through talking on stage about subjects I typically avoided thinking about, and receiving the immediate response of laughter—which to me says, I can relate to what you went through—I began to heal wounds I didn’t know I had. It enabled me to accept even my father’s worst behavior and finally go through the grieving process around my mom.\\n\\nJuly 17, 2017", "Here’s another way in which something that seems negative can be interpreted positively: If people are saying critical things about you, it means you’re worth talking about. And if they’re wrong about you, even better, because it means you’re worth making stuff up about.\\n\\nJuly 17, 201"]
