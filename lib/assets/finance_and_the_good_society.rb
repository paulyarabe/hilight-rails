book_notes = ["Young finance professionals need to familiarize themselves with the history of banking, and recognize that it is at its best when it serves ever-broadening spheres of society.\\n\\nApril 8, 2016", "Today, the best way forward is to update financial and communications technology to offer a full array of enlightened banking services to the lower middle class and the poor.\\n\\nApril 8, 2016", "Graduates going into mortgage banking are faced with a different, but equally vital, challenge: to design new, more flexible loans that will better help homeowners to weather the kind of economic turbulence that has buried millions of people today in debt. Young investment bankers, for their part, have a great opportunity to devise more participatory forms of venture capital—embodied in the new crowd-funding Web sites—to spur the growth of innovative new small businesses.\\n\\nApril 8, 2016", "Finance, at its best, does not merely manage risk, but also acts as the steward of society’s assets and an advocate of its deepest goals. Beyond compensation, the next generation of finance professionals will be paid its truest rewards in the satisfaction that comes with the gains made in democratizing finance—extending its benefits into corners of society where they are most needed. This is a new challenge for a new generation, and will require all of the imagination and skill that you can bring to bear. Good luck in reinventing finance. The world needs you to succeed.\\n\\nApril 8, 2016", "designing new financial inventions that take account of the most up-to-date financial theory, as well as the research revolution in behavioral economics and behavioral finance that has explored the real human limitations that inhibit rational and humane decision making. Creating and implementing such inventions will be the best tactic to deal with economic inequality. This future is in the hands of the people, old as well as young, who might read this book\\n\\nApril 8, 2016", "finance remains an essential social institution, necessary for managing the risks that enable society to transform creative impulses into vital products and services, from improved surgical protocols to advanced manufacturing technologies to sophisticated scientific research enterprises to entire public welfare systems. The connections between financial institutions and individual people are fundamental for society. Clarifying the terms of these connections and establishing a proper context for implementing and enhancing them is the subject of this book.\\n\\nApril 8, 2016", "Innovations could include the implementation of new and better safeguards against economic depression, including the proliferation of new kinds of insurance contracts to allow people to be more adventuresome in their lives without fear of economic catastrophe. We could also see innovative measures developed to curtail the rising plague of economic inequality that threatens to create serious social problems in our society.\\n\\nApril 8, 2016", "Our capitalist institutions do not yet fully live up to this ideal, but throughout history there has been a long trend toward the democratization of finance, the opening of financial opportunities to everyone. It is a trend we must hope will continue into the future. It is true that social barriers prevent some from realizing, and profiting from, their talents. An illiterate farm boy from a remote area finds it difficult to walk into the offices of a bank in a big city to ask for capital to start a business. There is a very real barrier to such people’s accessing capital, and there is substantial evidence of such a barrier in the extreme variation in interest rates paid by borrowers in different regions and different categories. Development economist Esther Duflo summarizes: “This body of evidence makes it very hard to believe that credit markets, at least in the developing world, are anywhere near the ideal market that would make the distribution of wealth irrelevant for investment.” But this is not a fundamental problem of financial capitalism. It is rather a problem of democratizing and humanizing and expanding the scope of financial capitalism .\\n\\nApril 9, 2016", "At its broadest level, finance is the science of goal architecture—of the structuring of the economic arrangements necessary to achieve a set of goals and of the stewardship of the assets needed for that achievement. The goals may be those of households, small businesses, corporations, civic institutions, governments, and of society itself. Once an objective has been specified—such as payment for a college education, a couple’s comfortable retirement, the opening of a restaurant, the addition of a new wing on a hospital, the creation of a social security system, or a trip to the moon—the parties involved need the right financial tools, and often expert guidance, to help achieve the goal. In this sense, finance is analogous to engineering\\n\\nApril 9, 2016", "curious and generally overlooked fact that the very word finance actually derives from a classical Latin term for “goal.” The dictionary tells us that the word derives from the classical Latin word finis, which is usually translated as end or completion . One dictionary notes that finis developed into the word finance since one aspect of finance is the completion, or repayment, of debts. But it is convenient for our purposes to recall that finis , even in ancient times, was also used to mean “goal,” as with the modern English word end .\\n\\nApril 9, 2016", "Finance does not embody a goal. Finance is not about “making money” per se. It is a “functional” science in that it exists to support other goals—those of the society. The better aligned a society’s financial institutions are with its goals and ideals, the stronger and more successful the society will be.\\n\\nApril 9, 2016", "In addition, finance involves discovery of the world and its opportunities, which ties it in to information technology. Whenever there is trading, there is price discovery—that is, the opportunity to learn the market value of whatever is being traded. This in turn involves the revelation of people’s feelings and motivations, and of the opportunities that exist among groups of people, which may in turn make even more ambitious goals possible.\\n\\nMay 6, 2016", "The CEO of a company is in a very special position, because he or she stands for an idea—the core idea behind the company’s activities, a way of thinking that defines the work of all the company’s employees, and a culture that includes its corporate values, connecting the company to the larger society. The CEO is responsible for the formulation of short-run goals that promote that very idea. The CEO embodies the purpose of the company. This responsibility has to be put, to a significant extent, into the hands of an individual and not a committee of equals, just as the writing of a novel usually has to be put into the hands of one individual.\\n\\nApril 10, 2016", "We still need the prefrontal cortex of one individual—however it may work—coordinating the activities of large groups of people. Large groups of people cannot be strategic or purposeful if they are leaderless\\n\\nApril 10, 2016", "A CEO typically serves for only a few years, during which time she or he has to set goals for a company that is much longer lived than the CEO’s own tenure. Thus there has to be an effective reward system that focuses the CEO on the long term. And this is a problem that lends itself to financial solutions\\n\\nApril 10, 2016", "less-developed countries, where there are fewer analysts, rating agencies, and newspapers and magazines to provide evaluation of investments. Hence banking plays an even bigger role in the economies of less-developed countries. 5\\n\\nApril 14, 2016", "But together they do in general have the effect of making markets more orderly and prices more reflective of true value. In the current environment the greatest hostility is often reserved for the traders, since they usually do not present themselves as helping society in any direct way. They are just buying and selling to try to make money for themselves. Their activities remind people of gambling—and the successes of some who excel in trading can be galling. Traders are very different from investment managers who manage large portfolios of investments, who set portfolios on their course for years on behalf of clients and their long-term goals. Traders put themselves at risk every minute of every day, and for no one’s benefit but their own.\\n\\nMay 28, 2016", "The existence of traders allows financial markets to respond almost instantly to new developments. When the price of a share of stock goes up, those who had bet on that stock are rewarded. Because of traders’ activities, the reward is virtually instantaneous, and it serves to encourage similar activities again and again\\n\\nMay 28, 2016", "The markets that traders make are a “valuation machine” that assesses the value of various actions in a constantly changing environment and that gives nearly instant feedback and corrections in the form of meaningful price movements\\n\\nMay 28, 2016", "May 28, 2016", "Far more important than high- frequency trading is trading of a broader scope —trading of more different kinds of things. The scope of trading has been gradually increasing over the past century. But progress has been slow, and still there are some extremely important assets for which there are no liquid markets. With the advent of high-scope trading, many more things are traded. An example would be the “prediction markets” that set prices based on the probabilities that a specified event will transpire.\\n\\nMay 28, 2016", "June 13, 2017", "The problem at the time was that our contracts didn’t become liquid enough to attract attention.\\n\\nMay 28, 2016", "To start an important new market, you need liquidity. To have liquidity, you need an important market. Market makers can sometimes create new markets, despite the chicken-or-egg problem, if they have enough capital and courage and commitment to make the market work. But it is a slow process, and we still have relatively few markets for individual fundamentals\\n\\nMay 28, 2016", "The public disgust with financial machinations is enormous right now, and such ideas are met with great skepticism. Many of those who object seem to think that such new markets would only create opportunities for bad behavior. But I find it ironic that no one (that I have ever heard) advocates shutting down trading in the major markets that already exist, like the stock market or the bond market. They don’t suggest this because the importance of this type of trading in our existing economy is just too great. So how does one draw the line between “good trading” and “bad trading”? If trading of claims on corporate profits (trading stocks) is a good thing, then why isn’t trading for claims on GDP likewise good? Corporate profits are, after all, just a (small) component of GDP.\\n\\nMay 28, 2016", "They do not seem to realize that the financial crisis was not primarily caused by a spontaneous outbreak of moral turpitude, but by a failure to appreciate and manage risks (notably real estate risk)\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "Life insurance was invented in the 1600s, but initially only a few financially sophisticated people bought it. The same was true of fire insurance. It was not until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that these kinds of insurance became widespread in advanced countries. And they still have not penetrated to many poorer regions of the world. The first imperative is to get a far broader segment of the public covered by existing, well-understood policies. For example, the fundamental tragedy of the Haitian earthquake of 2010, even including the loss of life, was that few buildings were insured there. This meant not only that there was no compensation for damage but also that there had been no insurance companies overseeing building codes in years past—a practice that certainly would have reduced damage and loss of life. The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility had since 2007 tried to establish better property insurance practices in Haiti, as well as other countries in the region, but it had made little headway when the earthquake of 2010 struck. This magnitude 7.0 earthquake caused at least fifty thousand deaths. In contrast, the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Northridge, California, in 1994—similarly significant in its proximity to an urban center and in its effects—resulted in only thirty-three deaths. The much better developed insurance industry in California as compared to Haiti is a major part of the explanation for this discrepancy.\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "The World Bank has been launching programs to better protect poor farmers against weather risks that might seriously damage their crops, causing massive hardship or even starvation. It has been estimated that about a billion people in the world have an income of less than one dollar a day, and that three-quarters of them live in rural areas that are heavily dependent on agriculture. 1 For these people the risk of crop failure is paramount, and this risk can be a life-or-death one. Foreign emergency aid tends to reach them too late, after they have already been forced to sell off their meager assets and slaughter their livestock just to survive. Primitive societies try to manage the risk of crop loss by risk sharing within the family. 2 But in practice all members of a family may be affected by the same crop failure, so this approach to risk management is far from ideal.\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "This would be a long-term insurance policy that an individual could purchase on a career, an education, or a particular investment in human capital. One could choose to specialize far more narrowly than is commonly done today—say, on a particularly interesting career direction—developing the expertise for such a career without fear of the consequences if the initiative turned out badly. The insurance policy would pay off with a supplement to one’s lifetime income if it turned out years or decades later, based on verifiable data, that there was less of a market, or even no market at all, for people with this career.\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "Ronnie Horesh has proposed “social policy bonds,” issued by governments, that would pay out more if certain social policy objectives were met, thereby creating a financial incentive for free-market participants to buy the bonds and then figure out how to meet the objectives. 3\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "1825, a newspaper article noted the profound importance of the search problem: “Experience proves that thousands lead a life of celibacy, not from choice but prudence, and the reason is obvious: it is because of a limited circle of acquaintance, persons of suitable age, disposition and circumstances cannot be found. We daily hear of unhappy differences after marriage, owing to the great dis-proportion of age, disposition, \\u0026 c., which, if there were more facility afforded to become acquaint\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "Even these early businesses must have helped people with the market problem of finding a matched trade, that is, finding a person who not only is suitable but also thinks you suitable in turn. Indeed, finding a coincidence of wants is one of the most painful and difficult aspects of dating. Perhaps the administrators of these plans could have helped people lessen the pain and speed the conclusion if they had used their experience in matching in a way that did not force people to search slowly and sequentially through a list of those who were for the most part uninterested\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "The strongest force shaping politics is not blood or money, but ideas.” 8 That is why the wealthy often prefer to sponsor partisan think tanks rather than lobbyists. But even think tanks are successful only insofar as they can make their ideas work in practice.\\n\\nApril 30, 2016", "“To have done anything by which you earned money merely is to have been truly idle or worse.” The key word in this sentence is merely.\\n\\nMay 3, 2016"]
