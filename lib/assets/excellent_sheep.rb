Nothing in their training has endowed them with the sense that something larger is at stake. They’ve learned to “be a student,” not to use their minds. I was talking with someone who teaches at a branch campus of a state university. His students don’t think for themselves, he complained. Well, I said, Yale students think for themselves, but only because they know we want them to. I taught many wonderful young people during my years in the Ivy League—bright, thoughtful, creative kids whom it was a pleasure to talk with and learn from. But most of them seemed content to color within the lines that their education had marked out for them. Very few were passionate about ideas.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "A friend who taught at Amherst mentioned a student who came to her for extra help with his writing—but only because he had already been admitted to medical school and now felt free to actually learn.

The frenzy of extracurricular activities has expanded to fill the available space, displacing intellectual pursuits as the focus of student energy. David Brooks and other observers have spoken about the death of the late-night bull session, the scarcity of spontaneous intellectual discussion. I’ve heard similar complaints from students at Brown, Penn, Cornell, Pomona, and Columbia. “I’ve never been able to justify to myself why I feel so much ‘smarter’—more productive, more creative, more interesting (and more importantly, more interest ed )—during the summers than I ever do during the school year,” a Princeton senior wrote me.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2014", "Now the magic terms are GPA, Phi Beta Kappa, Fulbright, MCAT, Harvard Law, Goldman Sachs.

But once you get to college, things are not so certain anymore. Directions multiply, and many of the paths are foggy. As Keegan suggested, being a musician does not have an application form. How do you become a social entrepreneur, a politician, a screenwriter? How do you get to work at the State Department, in Silicon Valley, for the New York Times ? How many options are there that you haven’t even heard of, and how does getting a job work, anyway? It isn’t any wonder, as graduation draws near, that a lot of students scurry frantically around, looking for another hoop to jump through.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "My friends and I didn’t run sprinting down a thousand career paths, bound for all corners of the globe,” he wrote. “Instead, we moved cautiously, in groups, plodding down a few well-worn trails so as to ensure that two or four years down the road, we could be stem cells again, still undifferentiated, still brimming with potential.”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "I think consulting in particular appeals to this perverse fantasy that most Ivy Leaguers harbor deep down inside, which is that someone should pay them for simply having gone to Yale or Harvard or wherever.

It is true, as well, that they are more apt to harbor creative or entrepreneurial impulses. But it is also true, at least at the most selective schools, that even if those aspirations make it out of college—a very big “if”—they tend to be played out within the same narrow conception of what constitutes a valid life: affluence, credentials, and prestige.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "The key word there is “safety.” Beneath the other factors—the entitlement, the lack of direction, the desire not to close down options—the force that drives the salmon run is fear. It is the exact fear (and more than fear: the panic, the often crippling anxiety) that lies behind that façade of serene achievement that elite college students learn to show the world. So extreme are the admission standards now, so ferocious the competition, that kids who manage to get into elite colleges have, by definition, never experienced anything but success. The prospect of not being successful terrifies them, disorients them, defeats them\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "nobody wants to take a chance on a class they might not ace, so nobody is willing to venture beyond the things they already know and do very well. Experimenting, exploring, discovering new ways to look at the world as well as new capacities within yourself—the things a college education is supposed to be about—fall by the wayside.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "I have seen students stumble for years, as many bright young people do today, unwilling to submit to doing something that they can’t feel passionate about but still not knowing where their passion really lies. One spoke of continuing to struggle not only with anxiety and fear, but also with ambition: not, that is, with a genuine desire for excellence, but with the feeling of being a failure if you don’t continue to amass the blue-chip names, the need to keep on doing the most prestigious possible thing—and the constant awareness, over your shoulder, of all the prestigious things that your former classmates are doing.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "I’m at medical school here in Canada and your sentiments apply beyond the Ivy League.” “We have our own Ivy League in India,” said another. “We call them Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIM). Every single thing you mentioned I have witnessed happening in practice.”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Some say they ended up in their profession because of someone else’s expectations, or that they simply drifted into it without pausing to think whether they really loved their work. Often they say they missed their youth entirely, never living in the present, always pursuing some ill-defined goal.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "But what of all the opportunities [that elite education] closes down—not for any practical reason, but just because of how it smothers you with expectations? How can I become a teacher, or a minister, or a carpenter? Wouldn’t that be a waste of my fancy education? What would my parents think? What would my friends think? How would I face my classmates at our twentieth reunion, when they’re all rich doctors or important people in New York? And the question that exists behind them all: isn’t it beneath me? So an entire world of possibilities shuts, and you miss your true calling.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "A whole new set of admissions criteria was developed to hold back the Semitic tide by making sure that the right sort” of student got in: letters of recommendation, alumni interviews, the preference for athletes and “leaders,” special treatment for sons of alumni (that is, “legacies”), an emphasis on geographic distribution, and a devaluation of pure academic ability. Better midwestern Protestants, even if they weren’t all the sharpest tools in the shed, than “greasy grinds” from Brooklyn. Princeton started requiring applicants to submit a photo, since you couldn’t always tell from the name. “Character” became the explicit ideal: manners, looks, tone, being a “Yale man”—all once guaranteed by where you went to school, now enforced through a subjective process of evaluation (and the admissions offices that had to be created to conduct it).\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Applicants, each represented by a long string of figures and codes (SATs, GPA, class rank, numerical scores to which the letters of recommendation had been converted, special notations for athletes, legacies, diversity cases, and so forth), had been assigned a single cumulative score from 1 to 4.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "In six hours of committee work, we disposed of somewhere between 100 and 125 cases, or about three or four minutes per applicant, looking for 10–15 admissions to fill out the rough allotment of approximately 40 for the region.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "The resume arms race,” as it is invariably called, is just like the nuclear one. The only point of having more is having more than everybody else. Nobody needed 20,000 atomic warheads until the other side had 19,000. Nobody needs eleven extracurriculars, either—what purpose does having them actually serve?—unless the other guy has ten.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "My office,” Levine writes, “has seen an endless stream of bright, talented children who are disinterested in school because ‘My parents think there are only two things to be in the world: a doctor or a lawyer.’ ” A Stanford student told me that his parents let him know that if he switched from engineering to humanities, they’d cease to pay his tuition. A recent Yale graduate who is pursuing a teaching career despite parental opposition wrote about “a mother bent on ‘opening doors for me’ and pushing me into an elite that she eyed with desire from the middle class. She wanted me to have everything instead of wanting me to have what I wanted.”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Parents of high achievers are often oblivious, even willfully so, to what their kids are going through. Levine cites a raft of troubling statistics: “Preteens and teens from affluent, well-educated families . . . experience among the highest rates of depression, substance abuse, anxiety disorders, somatic complaints, and unhappiness of any group of children in this country.” “As many as 22 percent of adolescent girls from financially comfortable families suffer from clinical depression.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Perhaps most disturbing of all, affluent teenagers feel less connected to their parents than do any other group of teens, including poor ones. Praise, Levine says, is not warmth, and the vaunted self-esteem that parents are so keen to instill is not the same as self-efficacy, the belief in your ability to get things done in the world. Hovering and criticism, adds William Damon, author of The Path to Purpose and many other books on child development, should not be confused with attention or guidance. High-pressure parents, as one of Levine’s young patients puts it, are “everywhere and nowhere at the same time.” They are intrusive, but they are not connected.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "My sense, as I have spoken with teachers at elite high schools, is that most understand what is wrong and wish they could do better by their students.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Some have described the ways they try to smuggle different values into the classroom, like love of learning or service to the community. The problem is they don’t have any room to operate. One teacher at a prep school in Westchester told me of a student breaking down in tears during a discussion of Catcher in the Rye . He didn’t want to have to be a stockbroker, like his parents said. That very night, she got a call from the boy’s mother: “Don’t put any ideas into his head.”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "A series that was published in a Palo Alto paper—Palo Alto, of all places—portrays an environment at the local high schools that is “hostile to learning.” The kids in “Doing School” rarely hear that education might be valuable for its own sake. “I went to Hopkins, a Yale feeder school, and hated it,” a former student wrote me. “The place turned learning into a simple endurance test, blithely awarding the best ‘athletes.’ ”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "The drug no longer gives them pleasure; it only takes away the pain—the pain, that is, of needing the drug. So it is with the drug of praise upon which these children are trained to depend: the praise that is the sign of parental love, for the achievement that is the condition of that love. Every A is a fix that temporarily quells the anxiety of failure, the terror of falling short\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "All achievement becomes a stand-in for parental approval. “He seeks insatiably for admiration,” Miller writes, “of which he never gets enough because admiration is not the same thing as love.”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "And so, Miller says, the gifted child—no longer necessarily a child, needless to say—swings incessantly between the poles of grandiosity and depression. Grandiosity is the delusion of supremacy. It’s what your parents told you when you did live up to their expectations: You’re perfect! You’re the best! You can do anything you want! It is self-esteem at its most distended, that rush you get when you ace your SATs or get the job at Goldman.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Depression is the state that ensues when you suffer a setback, and the delusion collapses. Depression means self-loathing, self-disgust, and the kind of emotional numbness that feels like psychic death. It also means self-punishment, which, among other things, is all those thoughts you use to make yourself feel bad—“I’m not good enough,” “I’m not smart enough,” “I don’t work hard enough,” “So-and-so is better than me,” etc., etc.—and which stems from the feeling that you don’t deserve to be happy. “If I didn’t take Zoloft,” a former student told me, “I would hate myself.” Grandiosity involves contempt for others; depression involves contempt for yourself\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Even getting a job at Yale turned out to be, like every achievement, no more than a temporary salve. Within a few months, he was asking me when I was going to get my dissertation published. But he wasn’t the real problem anymore, and his death, a decade later, made very little difference. The real problem was, as one of my students has put it, “the Frankenstein’s monster of ambition,” the insatiable need to be “the best.”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "I was missing my life. I was missing my chance to be happy, missing my chance to be free. I was also missing something else: the joy that comes when you stop feeling threatened by other people’s accomplishments and let yourself be open to the beauty that they bring\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Satan, who is not a beastlike creature in the poem, but the brightest of the angels, the first in his class, fallen, precisely, from excess ambition. He has arrived in Eden to destroy the happiness of Adam and Eve, and looking around himself, he thinks: the more I see Pleasures about me, so much more I feel Torment within me, as from the hateful siege Of contraries; all good to me becomes Bane, and in Heav’n much worse would be my state. That’s how envy works: the better things are, the worse they are, because they don’t belong to you.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2014", "Universities, writes Harry R. Lewis, the former Harvard dean, “have forgotten their larger educational role for college students”: to help them figure out who they are and what their purpose in the world should be. Schools, in fact, “are having a hard time making the case that the education they offer is about anything in particular”—or as he puts it more bluntly, “Harvard no longer knows what a good education is.”\\n\\nDecember 28, 2014", "There is no vision,” writes Allan Bloom, “nor is there a set of competing visions, of what an educated human being is.”\\n\\nDecember 28, 2014", "The suckage factor is a measure of how badly you suck at everything because you’re trying to do too much\\n\\nDecember 28, 2014", "Academic “units” (that is, departments) are seen as “revenue centers”; the ones that can’t pull their weight—much of the liberal arts—are slated for downsizing or outright elimination.

What they told me, invariably, was that they felt abandoned by their institution, that the education they were being offered had nothing to say to them and that they had no one to help them figure out how to live a life commensurate with their aspirations.

Beneath the cynicism that students feel they are forced to adopt, beneath their pose of placid competence, the longings of youth remain. There is an intense hunger among today’s students, my travels in the last few years have shown me, for what college ought to be providing but is not: for a larger sense of purpose and direction; for an experience at school that speaks to them as human beings, not bundles of aptitudes; for guidance in addressing the important questions of life; for simple permission to think about these things and a vocabulary with which to do so.

College is an opportunity to stand outside the world for a few years, between the orthodoxy of your family and the exigencies of career, and contemplate things from a distance. It offer students “the precious chance,” as Andrew Delbanco has put it, “to think and reflect before life engulfs them.” You can start to learn to think in high school, as Edmundson did—you’re certainly old enough by then—but your parents are still breathing down your neck, and your teachers are still teaching to the test, in one respect or another.

It’s a lot more difficult to put aside vocational considerations and think of college as an opportunity for personal development when you know you’re going to graduate with tens of thousands of dollars in loans. As one professor said to me, a family’s relationship to college is going to be very different when the price is fifty thousand dollars a year than it was when it was five thousand dollars a year.

Finding your purpose or embracing your vocation or whatever you want to call it is going to be easier for some kids than for others. If you’re lucky enough to graduate without a lot of debt, or your parents are supportive, psychologically as well as financially, you’ll have a lot more room to maneuver. The fact might shape your choice of where to go to college. Lower cost and/or less debt might be more important, may give you more options, than a shinier name—though it’s also true that net tuition can be cheaper (can be, not necessarily is) at a wealthier and more prestigious school.\\n\\nDecember 30, 2014", "December 30, 2014", "I will simply add one other thought, based on my observation of friends and students from across the economic spectrum.

They are compatible with religion, but they have also, in important ways, supplanted it. As traditional beliefs were broken down across the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—by modern science, by the skeptical critique of the Enlightenment—the arts emerged as the place where educated people went to contemplate those questions of meaning and value and purpose. Now the truth was multiple and personal, not settled and dogmatic. Instead of looking in the Bible, you read Dostoevsky, or listened to Beethoven, or went to see an Ibsen play. Libraries, museums, and theaters became the new churches, places where you came to court the old emotions of catharsis, transcendence, redemption, and joy.

It shows us that things do not have to be the way that they are now. It provides us with a vantage point from which to see that our conventional wisdom is just conventional, not wisdom—that what we think is natural is merely cultural; temporal, not eternal; particular, not universal.

Lewis suggests, a mentor looks for the questions behind the questions their advisees ask. “The most important job of the advisor,” he writes, “is to help students understand themselves, to face and take responsibility for their decisions, and to support and to free them to make choices that are at odds with the expectations others have for them.” Students look to mentors—figures “more attuned to their rising hopes”—to give them what their parents won’t or can’t: the permission to go their own way and the reassurance that their path is valid\\n\\nDecember 31, 2014", "students gravitate toward teachers with whom they have forged a connection. Learning is an emotional experience, and mentorship is rooted in the intimacy of intellectual exchange. Something important passes between you, something almost sacred.

Challenging your students takes time: you have to assign a lot of work, and you have to comment on it carefully. Caring about your students takes time: you need to be willing to talk to them, if only about their work, and often for a lot longer than seven minutes. Just learning how to run a class takes time: how to lead a discussion, how to ask a good question, how to deliver a lecture that is worth your students’ attention. The ten-thousand-hour rule applies here, too. But every minute spent on teaching is a minute that is not devoted to research. Good teaching isn’t simply undervalued; especially at elite universities, it is actively discouraged, because it’s seen as raising doubts about your seriousness as a scholar. “Winning the campus teaching award,” said Ernest Boyer, vice president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, “is the kiss of death when it comes to tenure.”\\n\\nDecember 31, 2014", "A 2005 survey of college freshmen found that less than one in six were “very satisfied” with the teaching they’d experienced.
