book_notes = ["the experience is the marketing. The best way to generate demand for your retail offerings is through an experience so engaging that consumers can’t help but spend time in your place, give you their attention, and buy your offerings as a result. Doug beautifully defines remarkable experiences as those that are engaging, unique, personalized, surprising, and repeatable . How can you design and stage a store experience that fits those five adjectives? Read here to figure that out.\\n\\nOctober 11, 2017", "Most people aren’t aware that Facebook uses ninety-eight unique data points to triangulate the moment-to-moment interests, needs and preferences of each of its users—whether they are logged into Facebook or not! Yes, even if you’re not logged into Facebook, bits of code and plug-ins scattered elsewhere around the Internet will continue to trace your activity, with a direct pipeline back to the mother ship: Facebook.\\n\\nOctober 12, 2017", "going-in assumption needs to be that there is no longer any way to buy enough attention to succeed. If you’re not good enough at what you do to drive earned media, attention and reputation, then there’s no amount of paid advertising that will save you. Your advertising can be content-driven, programmatic, location-based or a good old-fashioned TV commercial—it doesn’t matter. The odds of piercing the noise and reaching people, in numbers, who happen to give a shit about your brand are almost nil.\\n\\nOctober 12, 2017", "We shop to discover Shopping, at its best, always holds the hope of profound moments of discovery. The thrill of the hunt and the uncovering of treasure affect us, as humans, on multiple levels. Ironically, as our lives become more hyperconnected by technology and driven by data, the world around us becomes less discoverable and the odds of encountering things in an unanticipated way become much slimmer. That may sound counterintuitive but it’s a fact. Increasingly, the people, places and things that make it into our field of awareness are being driven by data and predetermined algorithmically. Social networks such as Facebook don’t expand our circle of friends; they actually contract it by winding us more tightly in relation to information, products, events and people that we “like” and shutting the door on those people, places and things that we’re less inclined toward.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "dating sites don’t attempt to bring uniquely different people together to create magic. They match people, like pairs of socks, in the interest of compatibility.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "The true joy of shopping lies in the delicate balance of relevance and randomness. While it’s true that as shoppers we appreciate being exposed to things that appeal to our conscious needs and preferences, we also crave the surprise and delight of encountering shops we had no idea we’d love, products we didn’t know existed and experiences that come out of nowhere to surprise and enchant us. Physical stores can and should be these enchanted places. And data, no matter how good it is, can never replicate the experience of genuine discovery.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "Crowds are the clearest and most immediate form of social proof , a reality that hasn’t changed since we climbed down from the trees tens of thousands of years ago. The presence of others in a space remains our best primal indicator that something of value is going on there. Most of us can relate to the adrenaline rush of being in a mall or a store and happening upon a feeding frenzy of shopper activity; it’s that feeling of excitement you experience when you sense that something big is going down.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "Apple recognized that the same sense of social excitement was absent from its online experience. This realization led the company to apply for a patent for what it called “enhancing online shopping atmosphere” on its websites. As Apple put it, “One drawback of online shopping is that the experience can feel sterile and isolating. Customers in such an environment may be less likely to have positive feelings about the online shopping experience, may be less inclined to engage in the online equivalent of window shopping (e.g., will not linger in front of a display), and may ultimately spend less money than their counterparts who shop in physical stores.”\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "The dynamics created by real-world crowds feed into our innate fear of missing out on a good thing, and it’s this flash of excitement that makes for memorable and addictive retail experiences.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "A shopper’s dopamine levels will be at their highest in anticipation of acquiring the thing they seek, and those levels will be even higher if there’s a known risk of not getting it. This outcome also goes a long way toward explaining the enduring appeal of off-price stores, outlet malls and even rummage sales, where shoppers have to treasure-hunt for bargains in their size, color or style. The mere fact that they may or may not find what they like produces enhanced dopamine levels.\\n\\nOctober 14, 2017", "So, as far as our brains are concerned, truly amazing retail walks a fine line between delivering consistency and dependability while also injecting the randomness of organic discovery and the fear of missing out. The subtle degree of chaos that we find in a physical shopping experience can, if engineered properly, add to the excitement of discovery. In other words, great shopping experiences are a sublime combination of predictability and chance\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "According to Blumenthal, “It’s about how can we create special moments. When you walk into the store, most people are really surprised, because it doesn’t look like any place they have ever been that sells eye glasses\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "stores are not places that stock products but rather “showrooms” where men can get fitted and select styles and fabrics for their suits\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Second, and perhaps more importantly, these stores provide a live showcase for Amazon’s digital devices, such as the Fire Tablet, Fire TV, Kindle ereaders, Echo digital assistants and Dash Buttons. Unlike Apple stores, which famously entreated customers to discover, touch and play with new devices, Amazon has had no such proprietary touch-and-play point in the market until now. As a result, the company hasn’t been able to penetrate the market with its devices nearly as adeptly as Apple has—a lost opportunity considering that Amazon’s devices are, in essence, the portals to the entire Amazon value proposition\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Indochino CEO Drew Green echoes a similar experience, saying, “Anytime we open a store in a city, we see awareness and sales in that city grow four times compared to what it was previously, as online-only.”6 I’ve also confirmed the same phenomenon with a number of large consumer brands. When they open a physical store, the result is very often an immediate jump in online sales. The math is physical stores equal more online sales.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "November 7, 2017", "A 2016 U.K.-based study found that physical stores are most valued by younger consumers, noting: “The age groups most attached to stores are 16–24 and 25–34 year olds. Their use of online pure-play retailers is also notably low. This not only reinforces the importance of physical stores today, but also indicates their likely future importance.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "one Millennial told us, ‘You want to touch it; you want to smell it; you want to pick it up\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Yet another study found that nearly half of millennials value the experience they have with a brand more than the product itself. This number compared to only 22 percent of baby boomers. Forty-eight percent of millennials feel that the experience they have with a brand is the greatest predicator of loyalty, compared with 17 percent of boomers who feel the same\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Digital is what we’ve become and yet visceral is what we are... it’s what we crave. Our need to detach from the Internet and escape to reality, if only for a while, is powerful and will continue to grow as we become increasingly chained to technology.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "So, if we’re honest about it, the problem isn’t that millennials dislike physical stores; it’s that most store experiences suck. I’m not saying this lightly or for effect. I mean it sincerely. Most stores we visit are devoid of any theater, excitement or aesthetic delight, much less any sort of engaging physical experience. The vast majority of retail stores are havens of humdrum and bastions of boredom!\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "They’re making a huge assumption that consumers are craving more engagement with technology than they already have each day. In a world where we’re looking at our phones 220 times a day, a physical store shouldn’t simply be a place to go and look at it for the 221st time. A store needs to be a place where magic happens and, sometimes, that magic might involve technology but it needn’t have to.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "It’s not about standing in the middle of a dusty warehouse speaking to a chatbot about product needs. It’s relating with an enthusiastic and delightfully human product expert who is empowered with technology that makes them even more expert. It’s not about using virtual reality to escape the boredom of the store. It’s using a remarkable store to escape reality—to enter a different world—just for a while.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "So, finding the critical balance between the physical and the digital begins with skillful and thoughtful experiential design. Searching for experiential inflection points where shoppers can be physically engaged and immersed is key. Technology can be the spark that brings remarkable store experiences to life or it can be the connective tissue between the moments along the path to purchase, but retailers must never lose sight of the intrinsic physicality and joyfully kinetic nature of live retail. In a way, every store needs to be a small Coachella experience—an experience that engages all five senses and remains with shoppers long after they’ve left the store. An experience they feel in every cell.\\n\\nNovember 7, 2017", "Retail, today, lives and dies by square-foot sales. And it is for that single reason that a plethora of unique, fun, fashionable and fascinating products, concepts and innovations will likely never see the light of day on a major chain’s sales floor. This one metric throws cold water on any flame of creativity. What buyer is going to risk their job to fill a large amount of floor space with products that are unlikely to sell in large quantity—even if those products might add exponentially to overall shopper enjoyment or enhance their sense of discovery?\\n\\nNovember 8, 2017", "So, it’s not that consumers are killing retail. Retailers are killing retail and consumers are just innocent eyewitnesses to the crime. As long as retailers insist on maintaining their myopic focus on sales per square foot, stores will suffer, shoppers will get shortchanged and retailers will compound their difficulties.\\n\\nNovember 8, 2017", "Something has to break this cycle of boredom in physical stores. And the road to salvation begins with expanding our view of how success in a physical store can be measured above and beyond per-square-foot sales. We need to completely reinvent the purpose of a physical store and the means by which we measure its success.\\n\\nNovember 8, 2017", "In the current era, retailers spend a disproportionate amount of their time busying themselves with products. They buy them, inventory them, move them from place to place, merchandise and itemize them. They mark them up, mark them down, sell them, accept them back as returns and then physically count every damn one of them at least once a year. It’s to the point that in most retail companies, so many resources go to the movement and maintenance of product that customer experience becomes an afterthought, a mere garnish. But in the retail space of the future, the most important product will be the experiences it offers shoppers.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "We won’t venture to the grocery store to haul home a turkey. We will visit a retail space to learn how to properly cook one.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "The design of the space is rounded out with unique pieces of custom artwork that pay tribute to music, sound and technology and also features open lounge spaces where Sonos’ visitors can just hang and chill out. According to Dmitri Siegel, Sonos’ vice president of global brand and executive creative director, “The whole store experience is based on the idea of being in a really comfortable and inspiring environment, listening to music you love, but hearing it in a way you never have before.”\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "What Sonos understands is that the world has no need for another electronics store. It needs beautiful spaces where people can gather to celebrate the unique sensorial joy of listening to music.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "Ultimately, shoppers should become active participants in your brand story. After all, story is what we see, hear, taste, touch and engage with. It’s the people we talk with and the feeling we take home with us. Story helps you bring the same feeling into your retail space that you might find in Disney’s Magic Kingdom. It’s that feeling of entering a completely different world.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "Therefore, the retail space of the future will not be a place we go to simply take something home. It will, more often than not, be a place we go to make something. No longer merely passive pack mules, shoppers will take an active role in customizing and personalizing the items they’re interested in.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "According to one study, shoppers are willing, on average, to pay 20 percent more for customized goods and “gave companies a 50 percent higher net promoter score—a standard way of measuring customer loyalty—than customers who bought regular products from the same manufacturer.”3 The retail space of the future, therefore, will be much more a workshop and design studio than the old-fashioned store we live with today.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "Staff at Pirch come from all backgrounds and walks of life. The company places less emphasis on product knowledge and much more on personality. Product, Murad says, can be taught, but the right mindset for delighting customers is key. “Retail can be fun when you have the right culture, and the right theater and experience,” he adds.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "So how does a store that professes not to care about sales generate such incredible sales numbers? By building a culture that single-mindedly delivers great customer experiences. Murad tells me that the challenge facing Pirch was not simply to sell products, but “in a cynical world, [to] create a culture of empathy and authenticity.” It’s an ethos that strives to make the time spent in a Pirch store thoroughly delightful and memorable.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "The philosophy at Pirch is that if its employees can achieve true happiness in their work and in their lives, they’ll be more likely to share that happiness with every customer who comes to the store. Co-founder Sears summed it up in an interview with Fortune magazine saying, “Our job is to make every guest feel like their time in our store is the best part of their day, whether or not they buy anything.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "When I ask Murad how all that kumbaya actually gets measured, he assures me that it’s not all about hugs and good feelings. Apart from sales and other financial metrics, he says the company’s “net promoter score” (the number of people who would recommend the experience to a friend or family member) is key. “Even Yelp reviews,” he says, are looked at closely, quickly adding that Pirch’s Yelp scores exceed those of Four Seasons Hotels in every city the brand operates in, revealing yet another important aspect of the company’s competitive mindset. For Pirch, the competition isn’t Home Depot or Lowe’s. The real competition is any other truly remarkable experience in the marketplace, regardless of category\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "physical shopping spaces will need to be better designed as gathering places for people. As Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, recently put it while describing the Apple store of the future, “We don’t really need to open more stores, but we need to open incredible places that almost behave like a town square, like a gathering place.”7 The store of tomorrow will become a place that celebrates the activities and lifestyles associated with a range of products. We will go to stores to interact with others who share our passions. Product acquisition may happen within the four walls of the store or it may take place later, across an ecosystem of purchase alternatives; it won’t matter either way. What will matter is that experiences and interactions in these remarkable spaces will act as the catalysts for a powerful relationship between a customer and a brand and forge a deep sense of customer community.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "the role of the shopping space of the future will not be to convert shoppers into buyers; it will be to turn shoppers into fanatical, lifelong converts and advocates for the brand.\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "Seven years after embarking on his unconventional approach to selling shoes, Mycoskie decided to open an equally unusual retail space in Venice Beach, California—a space that can only be described as a super-cool community hangout masquerading as a retail space. The store features an espresso bar, plenty of relaxed lounge seating and comfortable outdoor spaces where people bring their dogs. For a brand that began as a wholesaler and online retailer, the move to build a store was significant in terms of physically defining the TOMS brand. Mycoskie described his vision for the space: “We’re going to give free Wi-Fi in a beautiful space on an incredible street. People are going hang out here all day and they’re not going to buy anything.”12 Some friends and colleagues warned that the venture would end up being a disaster. Mycoskie, however, had faith that the space could be a commercial success. “I don’t have research to prove this,” he said at the time, “but the people who come here every day, over time, can’t fight the human, compulsive desire to buy something\\n\\nNovember 11, 2017", "Shechtman acknowledges that STORY’s concept might not be suited to every market, but she nonetheless feels that brands are ignoring a tremendous opportunity to use stores as a media channel. “Starbucks gets 55 million people into its stores in the U.S. every week. Target gets 30 million a month. Those are major impressions. When you look at that at scale with so many other retailers, why aren’t brands doing more in those spaces and looking at it as a marketing and advertising tool and not just about consumption?\\n\\nNovember 24, 2017", "Therefore, as retail spaces become more experiential in nature, they’ll require human beings to operate and demonstrate products for consumers. And artificial intelligence, while tremendous at retrieving factual data and solving linear problems, is not so adept at intuiting creative and sometimes lateral solutions, much less forging an emotional connection with a customer. Technology, on its own, tends not to be the optimal solution. Above all else, what humans bring to the table is their humanity. The retail workers of the future will be creative problem solvers who use lateral thinking to assist customers. They will be adept with technology and employ clienteling and other technologies to expertly guide shoppers and personalize recommendations.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "the retail associates of the future will not need to protest or picket for a living wage. Instead, they will have employers falling over themselves to pay them well because the retail shopping space of the future will marry the efficiency and effectiveness of technology with the expertise, enthusiasm, empathy and creativity of outstanding human beings. Retail will cease to be the job it has become and reclaim its rightful place as a profession people can be proud to pursue.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "visioning—the idea that if you can envision a desired future state, you can realize that future state. If you’re able to envision the future that this book points to, then I believe your likelihood of transitioning to that future is significant. The question is how best to initiate that transition.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "no one needs what you sell. That’s the bad news. The good news is that the world desperately needs how you sell what you sell—the unique, remarkable and ownable experience you design around your product. How you sell what you sell is what will ultimately set you apart from competitors and win the hearts of consumers. How you sell what you sell will create the intangible value that consumers are willing to spend more of their money on. And how you sell what you sell will make your business indispensable to your customers.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "I can easily count on one hand the number of companies that actually invest in identifying, measuring, nurturing or rewarding the human organizational creativity that fuels such innovation. This is particularly ironic because corporations are notorious for measuring even the most inconsequential and tedious of things, yet the vast and astounding value of creativity is most often overlooked or, worse, treated like black magic that simply occurs as spontaneously as lightning strikes. Creativity is undoubtedly one of the least measured and most misunderstood assets a company possesses.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "in a recent quarterly report, Amazon listed the “highlights” from the quarter. In all, there were twenty-six separate major initiatives—new products, technologies, programs, content, platforms, alliances and business models. For most companies, twenty-six initiatives would be an ambitious year. At Amazon, it’s a typical quarter. Amazon is a veritable innovation factory.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "Schoolteachers, for example, often consciously promote creativity as a goal of education but frequently display a discomfort with children who seem overly curious and non-conforming—both of which are traits closely associated with creativity.3 It stands to reason therefore that for many of us, our introduction to creativity was witnessing a classmate being shot down by an authority figure for attempting to be creative. And the experience was even worse when we were the one being shot down!\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "Reed Hastings asked, what if movies could come to you instead of you going to a video store? Netflix was born. Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp asked, what if you could solve the problem of getting a cab in San Francisco anytime you needed one? Now people in San Francisco and hundreds of other cities use Uber.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "Leaders can also encourage companywide questioning by being more curious and inquisitive themselves,” he says. He cautions, however: “This is not necessarily easy for senior executives, who are used to being the ones with the answers\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "When it comes to retail, consumers have well-formed scripts. When entering a store, we anticipate that a clerk will ask, “Can I help you?” When we check out, we expect the cashier to ask, “Did you find everything you were looking for?” As a consequence, we respond reflexively, according to the script. I’ve even found myself telling salespeople “I’m just looking” purely out of instinct, even when I could actually use their help. Breakthroughs can occur once we identify the typical script in our industry or category. Once we understand what consumers are preprogrammed to expect, we can then look for creative, relevant and valuable ways to change the script to create surprise, interest and infinitely more unique experiences.\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "Instead, your innovation teams should work to prototype the best ideas almost immediately—not in weeks or months but within hours or days, if possible. At Google, staff use what they call a Design Sprint process that unfolds over a five-day period and has an equivalent number of steps. Using these steps, groups can go from ideation to testing in a fraction of the time normally attributed to innovation cycles\\n\\nNovember 25, 2017", "The key to developing the organizational courage to go first lies in developing a system and structure for innovation—an accepted manner of scanning the landscape for ideas and moving them into testing, evaluation and execution\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "An interesting way to break the organizational tendency to innovate by 10 percent and move toward ten-times improvement is to imagine a future state in which the product(s) you sell will be free or sold to customers at cost. In that future, how could your business survive? How could you still generate revenue? What other business models or revenue streams could be introduced to make up the shortfall? What value could you offer customers over and above the product itself?\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "The question is simply, how else could your retail business make money? Could you create experiences that are so good that customers are willing to pay for them? Would shoppers pay to become members? Could you hold instructional events in your space that are so fantastic that shoppers would happily pay admission? Could you showcase products that are difficult to find—prototypes and concept products? Or could your store be an experiential laboratory, a real-world research facility, a data factory that brands are willing to pay to access and learn from?\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "Ironically, I believe it’s exactly this misplaced digital importance that is causing so many retail innovation efforts to fall flat. The fact is that no one needs a digital experience at all. What retailers should be setting out to do is to design unique, memorable, valuable experiences— some of which may be supported or enabled through digital technologies. Rather than treating the absence of digital as the problem, retail leaders should instead address the absence of remarkable experiences in most of their stores—which to some extent may be aided by incorporating digital solutions.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "Entering the store, browsing selections, learning and trialing products, receiving service, paying, arranging shipping, exiting the store and even providing after-sale support are all critical turning points in the brand story that must be meticulously considered and elegantly designed to be deliberate and delightful. Once that unique brand experience is fully imagined, then, and only then, can decisions be made as to how it could or should be animated. Some of these experiences may be best delivered digitally, some may not and still others may come to life through some combination of digital and nondigital assets.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "Apple CEO Steve Jobs put it, “You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work back to the technology.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "Most importantly, because networks have less infrastructure than empire businesses, all members of the network can dedicate more of their energy to delighting customers, thus creating a virtuous cycle that returns value to the network as a whole.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "I reckon that if you and I were to visit ten local stores together today, the experiences that we’d have in at least eight of them would be largely accidental. What I mean is that whether the experience was positive or negative, it would largely depend on circumstance, coincidence and chance and not on any deliberate or carefully planned experiential design. Whoever happened to be working that day, what mood they were in, what they happened to say to us when we arrived and ultimately how they met our needs would, more often than not, be entirely unplanned.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "What is abundantly clear from my research, however, is that the best, most successful and future-facing companies obsess about their customer experience above all else. They go to extraordinary lengths to ensure that it’s remarkable. And, like the team at Rolex when it’s crafting a fine watch, they design, engineer and fine-tune every aspect of it\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "Remarkable experiences are engaging. They connect to all five senses: of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. They involve the customer in a visceral way. unique. They incorporate methods, language or customs that are unusual, surprising or proprietary but also authentic and natural. personalized.

They incorporate elements or interactions that are completely unexpected. repeatable.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "More recently, the chain has allowed its employees to express themselves more freely while operating within these standards. To prevent the experience from feeling robotic or forced, “We’ve become intentionally less formal over time,” says Herve Humler, president and chief operations officer. He explains, “We focus now on authentic, unscripted conversation and interactions with the customer. In the early days when putting together this hotel company and growing it globally, we scripted almost everything. You’d hear ‘my pleasure’ repeated everywhere you went in the hotel because that was part of the script. We have evolved from that today and now encourage our employees to be themselves. To conduct interactions with utmost respect and courtesy, but in a way that is natural to their personality and the warmth of their caring natures.”\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "central guest history file, accessible by all Ritz-Carlton properties. This extra gesture of remembering a guest’s name, their plans and their preferences transforms an experience. Any retailer with a loyalty program should be leveraging that program—not only during the transaction but, most importantly, when the guest arrives in the shopping space, so that their needs, purchase history and preferences can be better catered to while they’re there!\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "It’s also typical to be pleasantly surprised by something while staying at a Ritz-Carlton hotel. In fact, staff are empowered to do just that. It may be something as small as having a unique treat sent up to your room—my wife and I, for example, returned to our room one evening to find an amazing little chocolate house had been left for us.

Achieving sprezzatura, however, is anything but effortless. It requires fanatical levels of design, training, practice and measurement.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "Today’s solitary, antisocial and systems-driven approach to ecommerce will give way to the immersive, realistic and connected digital experiences of tomorrow, which will be almost indiscernible from reality.\\n\\nNovember 26, 2017", "the staid and static physical stores we visit today will die off to make room for the dynamic and remarkable shopping spaces of the future: the places we go to learn, see, touch and play like never before.
