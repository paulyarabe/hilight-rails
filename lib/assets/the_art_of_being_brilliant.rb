It’s a given that if you switch on the news or pick up a paper then doom will prevail. We could point the finger at other people. The mood hoovers. You might even have married one! It’s hard to feel inspired if the people around you are having a ‘nightmare’. And then there’s the weather and the traffic!\\n\\nFebruary 11, 2017", "that it’s easier to be negative. In fact, it takes no effort whatsoever to conform to ‘normal’.

It works this way. You can walk into a dark room, flip on the switch and immediately the room is lighted. Flipping the switch did not generate the electricity; it released the electricity which had been stored. Positive thinking works that way – it releases the abilities which you have\\n\\nFebruary 11, 2017", "Here’s an interesting thought for you. When was the last time you couldn’t sleep for excitement? Or the last time you stopped to smell some flowers? Or the last time you got up especially early to take a walk at sunrise?

Knowledge is at our fingertips. Google has opened up a world of instant information. Then there’s fast food and microwave meals... ping... ‘tea’s ready’. My wife made a Christmas list and inked in at number one was a ‘ten second kettle’. You don’t have to wait for a cuppa nowadays. The kettle boils instantly! (I think she’s missing the point that the whole raison d’être of a cup of tea is that you sit down for a couple of minutes while the kettle boils.) Last night, I watched the BBC One-minute World News. A 100mph summary, crammed into 60 seconds, because we haven’t got time for proper news. You may have heard of a phenomenon called ‘speed dating’.

What if it’s the happiest kids that do best at school? What if it’s the most upbeat and happy sales person that attracts the most customers and effortlessly achieves their targets?

So, I now go home with the objective of triggering a positive set of feelings in my family. It’s a conscious and determined effort to ditch the old habits of whingeing, moaning and griping. I ask my children about the highlight of their day. And I ask them enthusiastically. Then I listen for the answer and engage with them. Getting home has become a thing of joy and smiles.

Let me set the scene for this awesome quote below. My son plays rugby on a Sunday morning. Kev Brown is one of the dads and also the coach. He, like many other parents, gives up masses of time and is a role model of positivity. He took a minibus of under 10s to Twickenham to watch Leicester v.

Work out what you have to do to get there 4. Do it! Wow! Have you ever read anything so brilliantly simple? David Hyner introduced me to his goal setting pyramid some years ago.
