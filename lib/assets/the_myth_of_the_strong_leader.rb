Due process means involving all the senior politicians with relevant departmental responsibilities in the decision-making process\\n\\nApril 9, 2017", "There are many qualities desirable in a political leader that should matter more than the criterion of strength, one better suited to judging weightlifters or long-distance runners. These include integrity, intelligence, articulateness, collegiality, shrewd judgement, a questioning mind, willingness to seek disparate views, ability to absorb information, flexibility, good memory, courage, vision, empathy and boundless energy. Although incomplete, that is already a formidable list. We should hardly expect most leaders to embody all of those qualities. They are not supermen or superwomen – and they should never forget it, even though it would be a requirement too far to add modesty to this inventory of leadership desiderata.\\n\\nApril 9, 2017", "To a large extent, it is followers who bestow charisma on leaders, when that person seems to embody the qualities they are looking for.10 During a good deal of his political career Winston Churchill was as much derided as he was admired.\\n\\nApril 9, 2017", "Charismatic leadership can be won and lost, and is not generally a lifetime endowment. It is often dangerous, and frequently overrated. More useful categories of leadership, I suggest, are the redefining and the transformational. Each of them is the subject of a chapter in this book. Redefining leadership, as I\\n\\nApril 9, 2017", "use the term, means stretching the limits of the possible in politics and radically altering the political agenda. It can be exercised by the leadership of political parties, collectively as well as individually. Parties which aspire to win elections generally feel a need to seek the ‘centre ground’. However, redefining leaders, whether as individuals or collectively, seek to move the centre in their direction. They aim to alter people’s thinking on what is feasible and desirable. They redefine what is the political centre, rather than simply accept the conventional view of the middle ground at any particular time, then placing themselves squarely within it. Franklin D. Roosevelt, with the New Deal, and Lyndon B. Johnson with his ‘Great Society’ reforms and civil rights legislation, provided twentieth-century American examples of redefining administrations.\\n\\nApril 9, 2017", "Transformational leaders are the rare people who make a still bigger difference. By a transformational leader I mean one who plays a decisive role in changing the economic system or political system of his or her country or who, even more remarkably, plays a crucial part in changing the international system. That is setting the bar high, but it enables us to make a distinction between even seriously reforming and redefining leaders, on the one hand, and those who play an indispensable role in effecting systemic transformation, on the other. The political context is all important. A transformational leader is extremely rare in a democracy for the simple reason that democracies do not normally undergo sudden transformations. Change tends to be sufficiently gradual that no one leader can be seen to have played a definitive part in systemic change. Fundamental change – for better or worse – tends to occur more rapidly within authoritarian regimes. It can be seen most clearly in the course of transition to or from authoritarian rule. When, however, we speak of transformational leaders, the focus is on systemic change that is for the better.\\n\\nApril 9, 2017", "In his famous study of presidential power, Richard E. Neustadt began by stressing the limits on the power of an American president, and it was Truman’s perception of this on which he especially drew. Truman said: ‘I sit here all day trying to persuade people to do the things they ought to have sense enough to do without my persuading them . . . That’s all the powers of the President amount to.’33\\n\\nApril 14, 2017", "Thatcher may be regarded as one of a minority of party leaders and prime ministers within democracies who radically redefined the terms of the political debate, but whose style of leadership, nevertheless, led to hubris and her downfall.\\n\\nApril 14, 2017", "leadership, as distinct from power, was to be observed where all the members were ‘on an equal footing’, yet where there was ‘generally some person whose counsel is more followed’ than that of others.6 This is leadership in its purest form, defined as someone other people wish to be guided by and to follow\\n\\nJune 13, 201"]
