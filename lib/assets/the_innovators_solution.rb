book_notes = ["The problem for growth-seeking managers, of course, is that the exciting growth markets of tomorrow are small today.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "We can trust a theory only when its statement of what actions will lead to success describe how this will vary as a company’s circumstances change. 23 This is a major reason why the outcomes of innovation efforts have seemed quite random: Shoddy categorization has led to one-size-fits-all recommendations that in turn have led to the wrong results in many circumstances.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "The Innovator’s Solution, in contrast, summarizes a set of theories that can guide managers who need to grow new businesses with predictable success—to become the disruptors rather than the disruptees—and ultimately kill the well-run, established competitors. To succeed predictably, disruptors must be good theorists. As they shape their growth business to be disruptive, they must align every critical process and decision to fit the disruptive circumstance.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "In sustaining circumstances —when the race entails making better products that can be sold for more money to attractive customers—we found that incumbents almost always prevail. In disruptive circumstances —when the challenge is to commercialize a simpler, more convenient product that sells for less money and appeals to a new or unattractive customer set—the entrants are likely to beat the incumbents.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "Disruptive innovations, in contrast, don’t attempt to bring better products to established customers in existing markets. Rather, they disrupt and redefine that trajectory by introducing products and services that are not as good as currently available products. But disruptive technologies offer other benefits—typically, they are simpler, more convenient, and less expensive products that appeal to new or less-demanding customers.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "New-market disruptors’ challenge is to create a new value network, where it is nonconsumption, not the incumbent, that must be overcome. Although new-market disruptions initially compete against non-consumption in their unique value network, as their performance improves they ultimately become good enough to pull customers out of the original value network into the new one, starting with the least-demanding tier.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "If the technology can be developed so that a large population of less skilled or less affluent people can begin owning and using, in a more convenient context, something that historically was available only to more skilled or more affluent people in a centralized, inconvenient location, then there is potential for shaping the idea into a new-market disruption.\\n\\nJanuary 23, 2018", "January 23, 2018", "If history is any guide, the commercially viable innovations in clean energy will not come from government-financed research projects designed to make solar energy a preferred source of power in developed markets. Rather, the successful innovations will emerge from companies who carve disruptive footholds by targeting nonconsumption and moving up-market with better products only after they have started simple and small.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "The target customers are trying to get a job done, but because they lack the money or skill, a simple, inexpensive solution has been beyond reach. These customers will compare the disruptive product to having nothing at all. As a result, they are delighted to buy it even though it may not be as good as other products available at high prices to current users with deeper expertise in the original value network. The performance hurdle required to delight such new-market customers is quite modest. The technology that enables the disruption might be quite sophisticated, but disruptors deploy it to make the purchase and use of the product simple, convenient, and foolproof. It is the “foolproofedness” that creates new growth by enabling people with less money and training to begin consuming. The disruptive innovation creates a whole new value network. The new consumers typically purchase the product through new channels and use the product in new venues.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "The growth in the new value network does not affect demand in the mainstream market for some time—in fact, incumbents sometimes prosper for a time because of the disruption. What is more, the incumbents are comfortable that they have sensed the threat and are responding. But it is the wrong response. They invest massive sums trying to advance the technology enough to please the customers in the existing value network.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "First, get top-level commitment by framing an innovation as a threat during the resource allocation process. Later, shift responsibility for the project to an autonomous organization that can frame it as an opportunity.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "A company’s channel includes not just wholesale distributors and retail stores, but any entity that adds value to or creates value around the company’s product as it wends its way toward the hands of the end user.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "there needs to be symmetry of motivation across the entire chain of entities that add value to the product on its way to the end customer. If your product does not help all of these entities do their fundamental job better—which is to move up-market along their own sustaining trajectory toward higher-margin business—then you will struggle to succeed. If your product provides the fuel that entities in the channel need to move toward improved margins, however, then the energy of the channel will help your new venture succeed.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "The same situation exists in service businesses. Just as lower-performing products can take root in simple applications and then get disruptively better, so too technological progress often enables less-skilled service providers to disrupt more highly trained and expensive providers above them.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 2018", "What kinds of customers will provide the most solid foundation for future growth? You want customers who have long wanted your product but were not able to get one until you arrived on the scene. You want to be able to easily delight these customers, and you want them to need you. You want customers whom you can have all to yourself, protected from the advances of competitors. And you want your customers to be so attractive to those you work with that everyone in your value network is motivated to cooperate in pursuing the opportunity. The search for customers like this is not a quixotic quest. These are the kinds of customers that you find when you shape innovative ideas to fit the four elements of the pattern of competing against nonconsumption.\\n\\nJanuary 30, 201", "What do we need to master today, and what will we need to master in the future, in order to excel on the trajectory of improvement that customers will define as important?\\n\\nFebruary 19, 2018", "The advantage, we have found, goes to integration when products are not good enough, and to outsourcing—or specialization and dis-integration—when products are more than good enough.\\n\\nFebruary 19, 2018", "the general current flows from interdependent architectures and integrated companies toward modular architectures and nonintegrated companies. But remember, customers’ needs change too. Usually this happens at a relatively slower pace, as suggested by the dotted lines on the disruption diagram. On occasion there can be a discontinuous shift in the functionality that customers demand, essentially shifting the dotted line in figure 5-1 upward. This flips the industry back toward the left side of the diagram and resets the clock into an era in which integration once again is the source of competitive advantage.\\n\\nFebruary 19, 2018", "Three conditions must be met in order for a firm to procure something from a supplier or partner, or to sell it to a customer. First, both suppliers and customers need to know what to specify—which attributes of the component are crucial to the operation of the product system, and which are not. Second, they must be able to measure those attributes so that they can verify that the specifications have been met. Third, there cannot be any poorly understood or unpredictable interdependencies across the customer–supplier interface. The customer needs to understand how the subsystem will interact with the performance of other pieces of the system so that it can be used with predictable effect. These three conditions—specifiability, verifiability, and predictability—constitute an effective modular interface. When product performance is not good enough—when competition forces companies to use new technologies in nonstandard product architectures to stretch performance as far as possible—these three conditions often are not met.\\n\\nFebruary 19, 2018", "A company that finds itself in a more-than-good-enough circumstance simply can’t win: Either disruption will steal its markets, or commoditization will steal its profits. Most incumbents eventually end up the victim of both, because, although the pace of commoditization varies by industry, it is inevitable, and nimble new entrants rarely miss an opportunity to exploit a disruptive foothold.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2018", "The bedrock principle bears repeating: The companies that are positioned at a spot in a value chain where performance is not yet good enough will capture the profit. That is the circumstance where differentiable products, scale-based cost advantages, and high entry barriers can be created.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2018", "Competitiveness is far more about doing what customers value than doing what you think you’re good at . And staying competitive as the basis of competition shifts necessarily requires a willingness and ability to learn new things rather than clinging hopefully to the sources of past glory.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2018", "Brands are most valuable when they are created at the stages of the value-added chain where things aren’t yet good enough. When customers aren’t yet certain whether a product’s performance will be satisfactory, a well-crafted brand can step in and close some of the gap between what customers need and what they fear they might get if they buy the product from a supplier of unknown reputation. The role of a good brand in closing this gap is apparent in the price premium that branded products are able to command in some situations.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2018", "What is not good enough in certain tiers of the apparel industry has shifted from the quality of the product to the simplicity and convenience of the purchasing experience. Much of the ability to create and maintain valuable brands, as a consequence, has migrated away from the product and to the channel because, for the present, it is the channel that addresses the piece of added value that is not yet good enough.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2018", "don’t even question who makes the dresses in Talbot’s, the sweaters for Abercrombie & Fitch, or the jeans at Gap and Old Navy. Much of the apparel sold in those channels carries the brand of the channel, not the manufacturer.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2018", "The power to capture attractive profits will shift to those activities in the value chain where the immediate customer is not yet satisfied with the performance of available products. It is in these stages that complex, interdependent integration occurs—activities that create steeper scale economics and enable greater differentiability.\\n\\nFebruary 25, 2018", "The law states that when modularity and commoditization cause attractive profits to disappear at one stage in the value chain, the opportunity to earn attractive profits with proprietary products will usually emerge at an adjacent stage\\n\\nFebruary 25, 201", "We have concluded that the best money during the nascent years of a business is patient for growth but impatient for profit .\\n\\nMarch 26, 2018", "Money should be impatient for growth in later-stage, deliberate-strategy circumstances, after a winning strategy for the new business has emerged\\n\\nMarch 26, 2018", "Money needs to be impatient for profit to accelerate a disruptive venture’s initial emergent strategy process. When new ventures are expected to generate profit relatively quickly, management is forced to test as quickly as possible the assumption that customers will be happy to pay a profitable price for the product—that is, to see whether real products create enough real value for which customers will pay real money.\\n\\nMarch 26, 2018", "A business model that can make money at low costs per unit is a crucial strategic asset in both new-market and low-end disruptive strategies, because the cost structure determines the type of customers that are and are not attractive. The lower it can start, the greater its upside.\\n\\nMarch 26, 2018", "The growth engine is a much more delicate machine that must be kept running continuously by process and policy, rather than by reacting when the growth gauge reads empty. We suggest three particular policies for keeping the growth engine running. Taken together, the policies force the organization to start early, start small, and demand early success .\\n\\nMarch 26, 2018", "We suspect that founders have an advantage in tackling disruption because they not only wield the requisite political clout but also have the self-confidence to override established processes in the interests of pursuing disruptive opportunities. Professional managers, on the other hand, often seem to find it difficult to push in disruptive directions that seem counterintuitive to most other people in the organization.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "To build what will be a respectable growth business in five years, you have to start now. And you need to add new units to the portfolio of growth businesses in a rhythm that is dictated by the growth needs of the corporation five years hence. Companies that build while they are growing can shield their nascent high-potential businesses from Wall Street pressure, giving each one the time it needs to iterate toward a viable strategy and take off.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "The best way to do this is to budget for it—not just an amount of capital set aside to invest in disruptive growth, but a budgeted number of new businesses that need to be launched each year.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "Sony is the only example we know of that was a serial disruptor, having created a string of a dozen disruptive new-growth businesses between 1950 and 1982. Hewlett-Packard did it at least twice, when it launched microprocessor-based computers and ink-jet printers. More recently, our sense is that Intuit has been actively seeking to create new-growth businesses through disruptive means. But for the vast majority of companies, disruption has been at most a one-time event.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "e starting with a cost structure in which attractive profits can be earned at low price points and which can then be carried up-market; being in a disruptive position relative to competitors so that they are motivated to flee rather than fight; starting with a set of customers who had been nonconsumers so that they are pleased with modest products; targeting a job that customers are trying to get done; skating to where the money will be, not to where it was; assigning managers who have taken the right courses in the school of experience and putting them to work within processes and organizational values that are attuned to what needs to be done; having the flexibility to respond as a viable\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "strategy emerges; and starting with capital that can be patient for growth. If you start in conditions such as these, you do not need to see deeply into the future. Attractive choices that lead to success will present themselves. It is when you start in conditions that are opposite to these that attractive options may not appear, and the right choices will be difficult to make.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "Never say yes to a strategy that targets customers and markets that look attractive to an established competitor. Keep sending the team back to the drawing board until they’ve identified a disruptive foothold that established competitors will be happy to ignore or be relieved to walk away from. If you create asymmetries of motivation, your competitors will help you win.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "If your team targets customers who already are using pretty good products, send them back to see if they can find a way to compete against nonconsumption. When your customers are delighted to have a simple, inexpensive product because their alternative is to have nothing, all the techniques for pleasing customers that you learned in Marketing 101 will be easy and inexpensive. This also should spell welcome relief compared with the alternative, which is the massive investment typically required to make disruptive technologies preferable to the established products that customers already are comfortable using.\\n\\nApril 18, 201", "If there are no nonconsumers available, ask your team to explore whether a low-end disruption is feasible. They must devise a business model that can make attractive profits at the discount prices required to capture customers at the low end of the market, who can’t use all the functionality for which they currently must pay.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "If the project leader ever uses the phrase, “If we can just get the customer to . . . ,” terminate the conversation. Send the team back to find a way to help customers get done more conveniently and inexpensively what they already are trying to get done. Competing wishfully against customers’ manifest priorities has shortened the tenure-in-job of some pretty good people.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "segment the market in ways that mirror the jobs that customers are trying to get done.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "Ask these three questions about each of the entities that constitute the venture’s channels as well. It’s not just you. The channel companies’ processes and values—their methods and motivations—can cause your venture to come off the rails or even stall before leaving the station.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "In choosing the management team for your new venture, don’t look at the attributes that describe the people you might tap to lead a new-growth venture, or at the magnitude of their past responsibilities. Search their résumés for the problems they have grappled with, and compare them to the problems that you know this venture must confront.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "Be sure that in the beginning years after a venture is launched, the development team remains convinced that they aren’t sure what the best strategy is, in terms of products, customers, and applications. Insist that the team give you a plan to accelerate the emergence of a viable strategy. Call a halt to decisive plans to implement any strategy before there is evidence that it works.\\n\\nApril 18, 2018", "Be impatient for profit. When someone tells you as a senior executive that you must endure years of substantial losses before a new business will become huge and profitable, this flags a plan to cram a disruptive technology into a sustaining role in an established market. Some investments in sustaining technologies with extensive interdependencies across the value chain can indeed require years of massive investment. Let established competitors tackle those. In disruptive circumstances, patiently enduring years of losses generally allows a team to pursue the wrong strategy for a long time.\\n\\nApril 18, 201"]
