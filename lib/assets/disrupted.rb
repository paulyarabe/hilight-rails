book_notes = ["The term bubble , as I use it, refers not only to the economic bubble in which the valuation of some tech start-ups went crazy but also to the mindset of the people working inside technology companies, the true believers and Kool-Aid drinkers, the people who live inside their own filter bubble, brimming with self-confidence and self-regard, impervious to criticism, immunized against reality, unaware of how ridiculous they appear to the outside world.\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "I think they just want to hire younger people,” Abby says. “They can take your salary and hire five kids right out of college.” “Sure.” I’m not angry. I’m just dumbfounded. “I get it.” From outside comes the roar of a lawnmower. I glance out the window and see that the guys who mow our lawn have arrived in their truck. I make a mental note that this is one small luxury that we now will have to live without, because surely an unemployed man cannot pay someone else to mow his lawn. I’m not even finished getting fired yet and I’m already thinking about ways to save money. Should we get rid of cable TV? Will we stop going out to dinner? Can we still go to Austria?\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "It turns out that Cranium rarely speaks to any of the people in the sixty-person marketing department. He spends four days a week in the office. On Friday he works from home. He talks to Wingman and apparently to a few other people who are his direct reports, but that seems to be it. He never takes the gang to lunch, never pulls people aside to ask how they’re doing, never sets up a one-on-one just to check in or give you feedback. Instead, he conducts anonymous online surveys. Constantly. Are you happy? How happy are you? On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the happiest day in your entire life, how happy are you? What if anything could make you happier? How could HubSpot be better? “More surveys,” I suggest once.\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "Since Cranium is not in contact with me, I am left to get direction from Wingman. But Wingman is equally tuned out. One day he sets a meeting with me to ask how things are going. I tell him I’m not sure what they want me to do. He says I should just write articles for the blog. “Just write about anything you want,” he says.\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "Apple CEO Steve Jobs used to talk about a phenomenon called a “bozo explosion,” by which a company’s mediocre early hires rise up through the ranks and end up running departments. The bozos now must hire other people, and of course they prefer to hire bozos. As Guy Kawasaki, who worked with Jobs at Apple, puts it: “B players hire C players, so they can feel superior to them, and C players hire D players.” That’s the bozo explosion, and that’s what I believe has happened at HubSpot in the course of the last seven years. “How weird are you, on a scale from one to ten?” is an actual question that HubSpot’s twenty-something managers ask job candidates during interviews\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "“HubSpot was the first software company I worked for, and it was extremely eye-opening,” says a salesperson who joined the company during its early days and has since worked for other early-stage tech companies, which were equally clueless and out of control. “People in these companies live day-to-day. They don’t know how to run a sales team. They don’t have a sales process. They don’t even know what the product itself is going to be. The product itself keeps changing. It’s mind-boggling, the amount of time and money that gets wasted.”\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "Another thing I’m learning in my new job is that while people still refer to this business as “the tech industry,” in truth it is no longer really about technology at all. “You don’t get rewarded for creating great technology, not anymore,” says a friend of mine who has worked in tech since the 1980s, a former investment banker who now advises start-ups. “It’s all about the business model. The market pays you to have a company that scales quickly. It’s all about getting big fast. Don’t be profitable, just get big.”\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "She cries in her car. She has panic attacks about going to work. She feels humiliated. She has no idea what she did wrong or why she’s being let go. Paige, thirty-five, gets tossed on a Friday morning, a few weeks shy of her one-year anniversary, when her first batch of options would vest. Ironically, Zack fires her during Fearless Friday, our feminist empowerment team-building exercise. While a group of women just out of college are downstairs in a conference room making paintings on the floor, Paige, a former Wall Street analyst, is up on the second floor being sacked for an alleged lack of productivity. Zack tells her to clean out her desk and leave. She’s done. Right now. She gets no severance pay. She walks out, fighting back tears, and texts me from her car in the parking garage: You won’t believe this. I just got fired. When I call her, she’s crying. A colleague in the marketing department tells me that back in 2011, before my time, another thirty-something woman was fired after only four months on the job. She was pregnant with twins. “The company can do whatever it wants,” one manager tells me, and my jaw drops.\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "This is the New Work, but really it is just a new twist on an old story, the one about labor being exploited by capital.\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "Another way to drive down labor costs is to deny people employee status in the first place. Uber, the ride-sharing company, saves money by categorizing drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. Uber insists drivers prefer this because they enjoy more freedom. Uber and others in the “share economy” are creating a new form of serfdom, an underclass of quasi-employees who receive low pay and no benefits. As former secretary of labor Robert Reich put it in a June 2015 Facebook post: “The ‘share economy’ is bunk; it’s becoming a ‘share the scraps’ economy.”\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "April 28, 2017", "The employees are paid in part with stock options. The strike price on the options is calculated based on the valuation of the company at the time the options are granted. If you joined the company late, you probably have a high strike price. If the company goes public at a lower valuation—if it suffers a “cramdown,” as it’s called—then your options might be underwater.\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "We’re screwed, I keep thinking. We’re totally, absolutely screwed. Not because the ExactTarget product is better than ours, because who even knows, and who even cares? Having the best product has nothing to do with who wins. What matters is who can put on a great show, who can create the biggest spectacle, who can look huge and unstoppable and invincible, and who is the best at bluster and hype\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "But I’ve also tapped into a huge well of anger that I didn’t know existed.

The things Halligan said out loud are exactly what those people suspect their bosses were thinking about them when they shoved them out the door. Officially nobody ever gets fired because of age. Officially, their position no longer exists, or the department is changing priorities. But everyone knows the truth. They’re old, and they get paid too much. As my editor at Newsweek told me, “They can take your salary and hire five kids right out of college.” Now here is some asshole tech CEO who has just blurted that out, in an interview. On Facebook, Spinner chimes in. She writes an angry comment under my Facebook post telling me I am not a team player: “We’re all supposed to be solving for EV,” she writes. EV means enterprise value, and “solving for EV” means we’re all supposed to be doing whatever we can to pump up the value of the company. Then Cranium jumps into the fray. Instead of apologizing for Halligan he doubles down and defends the remarks. “I give Brian credit for being transparent and upfront,” Cranium writes. “A lot of CEOs are hard to read and borderline deceptive. With Brian you know what he is thinking and I think that is awesome.”\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "A gaffe is when a politician tells the trut\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "One of the maddening things about discrimination of any kind is that it is often difficult, if not impossible, to prove that it’s taking place. The bias is often subtle, or even subconscious. People at HubSpot rarely talk about age bias, and when they do, they’re not talking about older workers being treated poorly. They’re talking about how unfair it is that people in their early twenties are not given enough responsibility, just because they’re young. But at work people make frequent references to my age. They speak euphemistically about my experience , wink-wink. I am asked whether I know how to use Facebook.\\n\\nApril 28, 2017", "Start-up people talk a lot about the importance of “culture fit.” Wingman brought this up during our very first meeting, over lunch at the Thai restaurant, where he told me that he tries to hire people that he would like to meet for beers after work. In tech, the concept of culture fit is presented as a good thing. Unfortunately what culture fit often means is that young white guys like to hire other young white guys, and what you end up with is an astonishing lack of diversity. HubSpot’s problem isn’t just about age. The company also has issues regarding gender and ethnicity. There are plenty of female employees, but the company’s top ranks are stacked with men, almost all of them white. The sixteen-member management team includes two women. Of the eight directors, two are women, and aside from Dharmesh, everyone is white. Across the ranks of ordinary employees, as far as I can see there are zero black people. The first time I go to an all-hands company meeting I’m taken aback: It’s an ocean of white people, all of them young. It’s not just that everyone is white, but that they’re all the same kind of white. Klan rallies probably comprise a broader swath of the Caucasian population\\n\\nApril 29, 2017", "The tech industry’s ageism is blatant and unapologetic. It’s wrapped up in the mythology that has sprung up around start-ups. Almost by definition these companies are founded and run by young people. Young people are the ones who change the world. They’re filled with passion. They have new ideas. Venture capitalists openly admit they prefer to invest in twenty-something founders. “The cut-off in investors’ heads is thirty-two,” Paul Graham, who runs an incubator called Y Combinator.\\n\\nApril 29, 2017", "John Doerr, a legendary venture capitalist and partner at Kleiner Perkins, once said he liked to invest in “white male nerds who have dropped out of Harvard or Stanford and they have absolutely no social life.

The prospectus contains a warning: “We have a history of losses and may not achieve profitability in the future.” Note this does not say it will take a while to achieve profitability, or that profits will one day arrive but the company cannot predict when this will happen. Rather, the prospectus says the company might never become profitable. Sure, this is partly just a way to be conservative. Companies always exaggerate the risks to their business so that they can’t be accused later of misleading investors or overpromising. So what are you getting if you buy this stock? You’re not really investing; you’re speculating. You’re hoping that whatever price you pay, someday someone else will be willing to pay more for it. No doubt there are people who will buy HubSpot shares without ever reading the prospectus or looking at the income statement or balance sheet. They’re just buying a story. They’re also hoping that the IPO will deliver a little “pop,” meaning the stock will go up on its first day of trading, giving them an instant profit\\n\\nApril 29, 2017", "What’s most remarkable is that HubSpot pulled this off even though the company had come within a hair’s breadth of running out of money. Apparently this happens more often than I realized. “It’s called ‘Go public or go broke,’ and it’s not at all uncommon,” says Trip, a former investment banker and venture capitalist. “The one thing people do not appreciate is that these companies are incredibly fragile.

Maybe they really did come from a peer, or maybe he will have just made them up. Either way, this is going to suck.

I emailed them again, and asked them a few times, but they never responded.” “Oh,” I say. “Do you think maybe they just forgot to do it?” He winces, and shakes his head. “I don’t think so,” he says.
