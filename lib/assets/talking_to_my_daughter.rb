book_notes = ["This book grew out of my Greek publisher’s invitation, back in 2013, to talk directly to young people about the economy. My reason for writing it was the conviction that the economy is too important to leave to the economists.\\n\\nJune 23, 2018", "There was another reason I agreed to write this book. My daughter Xenia is an almost constant absence in my life. Living as she does in Australia and I in Greece, we are either far apart or, when we are together, counting the days until the next separation. Talking as if to her about things that the scarcity of time never allowed us to discuss felt good.\\n\\nJune 23, 2018", "Writing the book was a joy. It is the only text I have written without any footnotes, references or the paraphernalia of academic or political books. Unlike those ‘serious’ books, I wrote it in my native tongue. In fact, I just sat down at our island home in Aegina, overlooking the Saronic Gulf and the mountains of the Peloponnese in the distance, and let the book write itself – without a plan or provisional table of contents or blueprint to guide me. It took nine days\\n\\nJune 23, 2018", "Aborigines had poetry, music and myths of tremendous cultural value, but they didn’t have the means to attack other peoples or to defend themselves from the armies, the weapons and the germs that agricultural surplus-producing economies engender. In contrast the British, coming from Eurasia, had been forced by climate and need to generate large surpluses and all that came with them, from seagoing vessels to biochemical weapons. As a result, when they arrived on the Australian coast, the Aborigines didn’t stand a chance.\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "Geographical conditions predetermined that Africa, Australia and the Americas would be colonized by Europeans. It had nothing to do with DNA, character or intelligence. To put it simply but accurately, it was all due to the shape and location of the different continents. But there’s also another type of inequality that geography cannot explain: inequality within the same community or country.\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "Remember how agricultural surplus gave rise to the state and clergy? Its accumulation both required and led to an over-concentration of power, and consequently wealth, among the few who ruled over the rest – known as the oligarchy, which comes from the Greek words oligoi (‘the few’) and arkhein (‘to rule’).\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "nothing is reproduced with greater ease than the faith of the haves that they deserve what they get. Since childhood you have been caught up in a vicious logical contradiction that you barely noticed. On the one hand, you were appalled by the idea that some kids cry themselves to sleep because they are hungry. On the other, you were thoroughly convinced (like all children) that your toys, your clothes and your house were all rightfully yours. Our minds automatically equate ‘I have X’ with ‘I deserve X’.\\n\\nJune 24, 2018", "At any rate, debt came first. And since the amount of money paid to waged workers as wages, the amount of rent paid to the lord, the sums to be paid for raw materials and tools were all determined and agreed even before production had begun, the distribution of the entrepreneur’s future revenues was largely decided in advance of their existence – in fact, the only person who did not know how much he would end up with, after everyone else got paid, was the entrepreneur himself. In brief, distribution now preceded production. This is how the Great Reversal took place, turning debt into the primary factor and the essential lubricant of the production process. This is also how profit became an end in itself – for without it the new entrepreneurial class could not survive. Think about it. If the price of wool suddenly plummeted or some natural disaster reduced output, they would not only starve but end up with unpayable debts. As the expiry of their loan agreement approached, they would sink deeper and deeper into despair.\\n\\nJuly 22, 201", "In the context of the stag hunt, both are self-fulfilling. And this is the essence of Rousseau’s allegory: if a goal can only be achieved collectively, success depends not just on each individual pulling together but primarily on each individual believing that every other individual will do so.\\n\\nAugust 8, 2018", "let me now turn to the great, realistic hope close at hand: the belief, at least my belief, that humans have an inexhaustible ability to resist the erosion of their spirit and the cheapening of their labour.\\n\\nAugust 11, 2018", "In ancient Greece a person who refused to think in terms of the common good was called an idiotis – a privateer, a person who minded his own business. ‘In moderation as a poietis [poet], immoderately as an idiotis,’ the ancient Athenian saying went. In the eighteenth century British scholars with a passion for ancient Greek texts gave the word idiotis its current English meaning – a fool. In both these senses our market societies have turned us into idiots.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "impossible to talk about the economy without talking about politics.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "any attempt to depoliticize the regulation and management of the money supply would choke the economy and prevent recovery in the event of a crash. I concluded that the only solution was to democratize the process by which monetary decisions are made.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "a decent, rational society must democratize not only the management of money and technology, but the management of the planet’s resources and ecosystems as well.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "Your era will be typified by the momentous clash between two opposing proposals: ‘Democratize everything!’ versus ‘Commodify everything!’ The proposal favoured by powerful and influential people and institutions is ‘Commodify everything!’ They want to convince you that the solution to our world’s problems is to accelerate and to deepen the commodification of human labour, land, machines and the environment.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "The clash of these two agendas will determine your future well after I am gone. If you wish to have any say in that future, then you and your contemporaries will have to form an opinion on this matter and articulate good arguments with which to win others to your point of view. I am not going to pretend to be neutral in this clash, so I will say this. Commodification will never work. Markets do a great job when it comes to managing the supply of coffee shops in a city and, more generally, the distribution of goods among buyers with different tastes, just as we saw in Radford’s POW camp. But as I have attempted to show over the course of this book, they are terrible at managing money, labour and robots.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "In a democracy we have one single vote each. This is a prerequisite for the Greek concept of isegoria: giving different views equal weight. In markets, however, the number of votes one has is determined by one’s wealth. The more pounds, euros, dollars or yen you have, the greater the weight of your opinion in the markets\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "It’s the same with shares in a company: if you own 51 per cent of the shares in a company, you are its absolute ruler, even if the remaining 49 per cent are owned by thousands of people.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "Setting aside my bruised ego, my fear stems from a larger worry: that most people have no time to scrutinize society. We just want to get on with our lives, chat with our mates and enjoy the pleasures that market society provides. Maybe books like this seem at best a distraction or an irrelevance, at worst an obstacle to enjoying life.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "Every dominion needs a dominant ideology to legitimize it, a narrative that invokes fundamental ethical values in order to justify itself while threatening punishment for those who doubt in it.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "the economy is too important to leave to the economists. As we have seen in this book, economic decisions decide everything from the mundane to the profound. Leaving the economy to the experts is the equivalent of those who lived in the Middle Ages entrusting their welfare to the theologians, the cardinals and the Spanish inquisitors. It is a terrible idea.\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "there is something I recommend you take with you: the idea of the ancient scientist Archimedes that, given enough distance, nothing is impossible. ‘Give me somewhere to stand, and a lever long enough, and I shall lift the Earth,’ he said. All systems of domination work by enveloping us in their narrative and superstitions in such a way that we cannot see beyond them. Taking a step or two back, finding a way to inspect them from the outside, allows us a glimpse of how imperfect, how ludicrous, they are. Securing this glimpse keeps you in touch with reality\\n\\nAugust 16, 2018", "the best way to see your country, your society, is to see it through the eyes of an outsider, a refugee.\\n\\nAugust 16, 201"]
