Every day this passion comes to life in nearly every corner of the world, in an amazing mix of principled behavimpor that those in the coany refer to as the Starbucks Experience.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2017", "From Starbucks perspective, that “right way” to conduct business means truly turning employees into partners—shareholders with a stake in the outcome of the company.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2017", "But the treatment that partners receive at Starbucks goes well beyond stock options and health insurance. For example, partners are given extensive training in product knowledge, guiding principles for success, personal eowerment, and the importance of creating warm customer experiences.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2017", "the ambience of the store must be inviting; the store must be a place where a person will feel comfortable hanging out alone or with friends.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "how soundly and authentically the partners in that Starbucks had “made the store their own.” As he puts it, the staff chose to find enjoyment in their jobs. “It was helping not just Starbucks, but them, too.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "At Starbucks, “being welcoming” is an essential way to get the customer’s visit off to a positive start. It is also the foundation for producing a predictably warm and comfortable environment.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "Many important customer questions are answered in the first moments of a business interaction. Do the staff members care to get to know me? Do they remember me? Will they take care of my needs? Do I matter? Am I invisible?\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "Welcoming people by name and remembering them from visit to visit is a small thing, but it counts. The great Dale Carnegie recognized this in his book How to Win Friends and Influence People. Carnegie remarked, “Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.” Carnegie even suggested that a person’s name may be his or her most valuable possession.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "Joy is serious about knowing customers’ names. In fact, after work she enters information about her customers into a spreadsheet, which she later reviews. Starbucks leaders helped Joy appreciate the importance of being welcoming and praised her approach. They do not expect or encourage others to use Joy’s method. Instead, the leaders provide partners with the freedom to find what works best for them, their customers, and their stores.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "When someone actually notices us, as Joy notices her customers, it’s almost shocking, particularly if we haven’t visited that business in a while. In today’s frantic world, most of us expect to just blend in with the crowd. Unfortunately, as much as each of us may want to stand out, we often fear that we are just another member of the herd. Starbucks leadership understands that customers long to have their uniqueness recognized. Therefore, these leaders impart the importance of treating people in a way that leaves everyone feeling unique and special\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "Starbucks leadership helps partners embrace the idea of being genuine and the importance of that idea to the Starbucks Experience. The concept of what it takes to be genuine is fairly straightforward, but profound. At Starbucks, being genuine means to “connect, discover, and respond.” Focusing on these three elements in each customer interaction forms a quality relationship.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "Customers aren’t looking for best friends; they just want a positive connection, and they want their needs to matter. They resent being treated as if they were just wallets with humans attached. In order for a connection to occur, a person has to feel heard. Genuineness requires listening through both verbal and nonverbal channels.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "We are not in the coffee business serving people, but in the people business serving coffee. The equity of the Starbucks brand is the humanity and intimacy of what goes on in the communities... We continually are reminded of the powerful need and desire for human contact and for community, which is a new, powerful force in determining consumer choices... The Starbucks environment has become as important as the coffee itself.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "A sense of community—and respect for one another—is increasingly rare in the modern workplace. Coworkers frequently treat one another far worse than they do customers.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "Not only do Starbucks managers encourage partners to enhance their expertise in the areas of coffee and customer service, but the leadership also offers formal training opportunities and incentives for acquiring that knowledge. In addition, Starbucks executives understand something that few business leaders do: sharing knowledge with customers makes for more sophisticated consumers. As a result, these customers develop a passion for your products and services and are eager to explore the subtle nuances of what your business offers.\\n\\nNovember 19, 2017", "partners take a proactive approach to the future of the business. Rather than waiting for cues from the home office, everyone at Starbucks is charged with searching for new and better ideas for meeting and exceeding customer needs.\\n\\nNovember 21, 2017", "Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.\\n\\nNovember 21, 2017", "Howard Schultz is fond of saying that “retail is detail.” In reality—although this lacks the rhyming charm of Howard’s quote— all business is detail. When details are overlooked or missed, even the most patient of customers can be frustrated, and costly errors can occur. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of unhappy customers bring their complaints directly to management. They simply go elsewhere, spending their hard-earned dollars at coetitors’ stores and sharing their grievances with scores of family members, friends, and acquaintances.\\n\\nNovember 21, 2017", "If we can entertain them and send them out with an idea, a tool, something to discover, then we’re a bigger stop than just a cup of coffee.” That is the essence of great business leadership—finding ways to deliver existing products and services in ways that make the brand more significant to the customer. In Timothy’s words, we must make the experience “a bigger stop.”\\n\\nNovember 21, 2017", "Nobody tells you to leave or gives you a dirty look if you’ve been there over a half hour, unlike a certain donut haven I know. It’s a great place to go to talk with that special someone, catch up with an old friend, or escape after a stressful day at work. You can’t go to Disney World every day, unfortunately, so Starbucks is my affordable luxury.”\\n\\nNovember 21, 2017", "Starbucks could very well operate without even selling coffee. They could charge an entrance fee and offer nothing else but a room and mellow Bob Marley music softly playing in the background, and people would still come. Starbucks recognizes the niche they fill\\n\\nNovember 21, 2017"]
