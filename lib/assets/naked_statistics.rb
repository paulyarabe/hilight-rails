book_notes = ["Statistics rarely offers a single “right” way of doing anything. Does it provide meaningful information in an easily accessible way? Absolutely. It’s a nice tool for making a quick comparison\\n\\nOctober 10, 2015", "Statistics can help answer these questions (or, we hope, can soon). The world is producing more and more data, ever faster and faster. Yet, as the New York Times has noted, “Data is merely the raw material of knowledge.” 3 * Statistics is the most powerful tool we have for using information to some meaningful end, whether that is identifying underrated baseball players or paying teachers more fairly. Here is a quick tour of how statistics can bring meaning to raw data.\\n\\nOctober 10, 2015", "But one theme of this book will be that an overreliance on any descriptive statistic can lead to misleading conclusions, or cause undesirable behavior.\\n\\nOctober 10, 2015", "Descriptive statistics exist to simplify, which always implies some loss of nuance or detail. Anyone working with numbers needs to recognize as much.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2014", "December 29, 2014", "A statistical index has all the potential pitfalls of any descriptive statistic—plus the distortions introduced by combining multiple indicators into a single number. By definition, any index is going to be sensitive to how it is constructed; it will be affected both by what measures go into the index and by how each of those measures is weighted.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2014", "statistical malfeasance has very little to do with bad math. If anything, impressive calculations can obscure nefarious motives. The fact that you’ve calculated the mean correctly will not alter the fact that the median is a more accurate indicator. Judgment and integrity turn out to be surprisingly important. A detailed knowledge of statistics does not deter wrongdoing any more than a detailed knowledge of the law averts criminal behavior. With both statistics and crime, the bad guys often know exactly what they’re doing!\\n\\nDecember 31, 2014", "similar to other films that I’ve liked; it also recommends films that have been highly rated by other customers whose ratings are similar to mine. Bhutto was recommended because of my five-star ratings for two other documentaries, Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room and Fog of War .\\n\\nDecember 31, 2014", "So how well does the SAT fare in this regard? Sadly for future generations of high school students, the SAT does a reasonably good job of predicting first-year college grades. The College Board publishes the relevant correlations. On a scale of 0 (no correlation at all) to 1 (perfect correlation), the correlation between high school grade point average and first-year college grade point average is .56. (To put that in perspective, the correlation between height and weight for adult men in the United States is about .4.)\\n\\nOctober 10, 2015", "At the most basic level, Netflix is exploiting the concept of correlation. First, I rate a set of films. Netflix compares my ratings with those of other customers to identify those whose ratings are highly correlated with mine. Those customers tend to like the films that I like. Once that is established, Netflix can recommend films that like-minded customers have rated highly but that I have not yet seen. That’s the “big picture.” The actual methodology is much more complex. In fact, Netflix launched a contest in 2006 in which members of the public were invited to design a mechanism that improved on existing Netflix recommendations by at least 10 percent (meaning that the system was 10 percent more accurate in predicting how a customer would rate a film after seeing it)...There were two requirements for entry. First, the winner had to license the algorithm to Netflix. And second, the winner had to “describe to the world how you did it and why it works.”\\n\\nJune 18, 2017", "June 18, 2017", "June 19, 2017", "Let’s look at what that means. A total of 19,250 people are notified that they have the disease; only 9 percent of them are actually sick! And that’s with a test that has a very low rate of false positives. Without going too far off topic, this should give you some insight into why cost containment in health care sometimes involves less screening of healthy people for diseases, not more. In the case of a disease like HIV/AIDS, public health officials will often recommend that the resources available be used to screen the populations at highest risk, such as gay men or intravenous drug users.\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2015", "The Santa Cruz system was designed by two mathematicians, an anthropologist, and a criminologist. The Chicago Police Department has created an entire predictive analytics unit, in part because gang activity, the source of much of the city’s violence, follows certain patterns. The book Data Mining and Predictive Analysis: Intelligence Gathering and Crime Analysis , a guide to statistics for law enforcement, begins enthusiastically, “It is now possible to predict the future when it comes to crime, such as identifying crime trends, anticipating hotspots in the community, refining resource deployment decisions, and ensuring the greatest protection for citizens in the most efficient manner.” (Look, I read these kinds of things so that you don’t have to.)\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2015", "Texting while driving causes crashes, but state laws banning the practice do not seem to stop drivers from doing it. In fact, such laws might even make things worse by prompting drivers to hide their phones and therefore take their eyes off the road while texting.\\n\\nJanuary 1, 2015", "January 1, 2015", "Now that I’ve taught for many years, I’m more sympathetic to his line of thinking. In nearly every course I’ve taught, there is a striking degree of correlation between a student’s performance on the midterm and on the final. It is highly unusual for a student to score below average on the midterm and then near the top of the class on the final. I explained that I had finished my thesis and gotten serious about the class (by\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "To be more precise, any statistical inference begins with an implicit or explicit null hypothesis. This is our starting assumption, which will be rejected or not on the basis of subsequent statistical analysis.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "Null hypothesis: This new experimental drug is no more effective at preventing malaria than a placebo. Alternative hypothesis: This new experimental drug can help to prevent malaria.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "One of the most common thresholds that researchers use for rejecting a null hypothesis is 5 percent, which is often written in decimal form: .05. This probability is known as a significance level, and it represents the upper bound for the likelihood of observing some pattern of data if the null hypothesis were true. Stick with me for a moment, because it’s not really that complicated.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "Let’s think about a significance level of .05. We can reject a null hypothesis at the .05 level if there is less than a 5 percent chance of getting an outcome at least as extreme as what we’ve observed if the null hypothesis were true.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "January 2, 2015", "Is this an accurate sample of the population whose opinions we are trying to measure? Many common data-related challenges were discussed in Chapter 7. Nonetheless, I will point out once again the danger of selection bias, particularly self-selection. Any poll that depends on individuals who select into the sample, such as a radio call-in show or a voluntary Internet survey, will capture only the views of those who make the effort to voice their opinions\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "One indicator of a poll’s validity is the response rate: What proportion of respondents who were chosen to be contacted ultimately completed the poll or survey? A low response rate can be a warning sign for potential sampling bias. The more people there are who opt not to answer the poll, or who just can’t be reached, the greater the possibility that this large group is different in some material way from those who did answer the questions.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "Have the questions been posed in a way that elicits accurate information on the topic of interest? Soliciting public opinion requires more nuance than measuring test scores or putting respondents on a scale to determine their weight. Survey results can be extremely sensitive to the way a question is asked.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "If pollsters are to be considered honest brokers generating legitimate results, they must guard against language that is prone to affect the accuracy of the information collected. Similarly, if answers are to be compared over time—such as how consumers feel about the economy today compared with how they felt a year ago\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "then the questions eliciting that information over time must be the same, or very similar\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "To experts like Gallup’s Frank Newport, the answers to every question present meaningful data, even when those answers may appear to be inconsistent. 3 The fact that American attitudes toward capital punishment change dramatically when life without parole is offered as an option tells us something important. The key point, says Newport, is to view any polling result in context. No single question or poll can capture the full depth of public opinion on a complex issue\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "We know that people shade the truth, particularly when the questions asked are embarrassing or sensitive. Respondents may overstate their income, or inflate the number of times they have sex in a typical month. They may not admit that they do not vote. They may hesitate to express views that are unpopular or socially unacceptable. For all these reasons, even the most carefully designed poll is dependent on the integrity of the respondents’ answers. Election polls depend crucially\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "One way to minimize this potential bias is to ask whether a respondent voted in the last election, or in the last several elections. Respondents who have voted consistently in the past are most likely to vote in the future. Similarly, if there are concerns that respondents may be hesitant to express a socially unacceptable answer, such as a negative view of a racial or ethnic group, the question may be phrased in a more subtle way, such as by asking “if people you know” hold such an opinion.\\n\\nJanuary 2, 2015", "found that workers who have little control over their jobs—meaning they have minimal say over what tasks are performed or how those tasks are carried out—have a significantly higher mortality rate than other workers in the civil service with more decision-making authority. According to this research, it is not the stress associated with major responsibilities that will kill you; it is the stress associated with being told what to do while having little say in how or when it gets done\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "Is “low job control” really causing heart disease? Or is it some combination of other factors that happen to be shared by people with low job control, in which case we may be completely missing the real public health threat. Regression analysis is the statistical tool that helps us deal with this challenge. Specifically, regression analysis allows us to quantify the relationship between a particular variable and an outcome that we care about while controlling for other factors.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "At its core, regression analysis seeks to find the “best fit” for a linear relationship between two variables\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "But how do we know which is the best line for these data? In fact, how exactly would we define “best”? Regression analysis typically uses a methodology called ordinary least squares, or OLS. The technical details, including why OLS produces the best fit, will have to be left to a more advanced book. The key point lies in the “least squares” part of the name; OLS fits the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals. That’s not as awfully complicated as it sounds. Each observation in our height and weight data set has a residual, which is its vertical distance from the regression\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "However, I must warn that when we are working with a small sample of data—such as a group of 20 adults rather than the 3,000+ persons in the Changing Lives study—the normal distribution is no longer willing to be our friend. Specifically, if we repeatedly conduct regression analysis on different small samples, we can no longer assume that our various coefficients will be distributed normally around the “true” association between height and weight in the American adult population. Instead, our coefficients will still be distributed around the “true” association between height and weight for the American adult population in what is known as a t-distribution. (Basically the t-distribution is more dispersed than the normal distribution and therefore has “fatter tails.”) Nothing else changes;\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "Remember, we have not proved that taller people weigh more in the general population; we have merely shown that our results for the Changing Lives sample would be highly anomalous if that were not the case\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "R squared tells us how much of that variation around the mean is associated with differences in height alone. The answer in our case is .25, or 25 percent. The more significant point may be that 75 percent of the variation in weight for our sample remains unexplained. There are clearly factors other than height that might help us understand the weights of the Changing Lives participants.\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "Regression analysis (often called multiple regression analysis when more than one explanatory variable is involved, or multivariate regression analysis) will give us a coefficient for each explanatory variable included in the regression equation. In other words, among people who are the same sex and height , what is the relationship between age and weight?\\n\\nJanuary 11, 2015", "The New York Times Magazine asked a delicate but socially significant question: How many women died prematurely or suffered strokes or breast cancer because they were taking a pill that their doctors had prescribed to keep them healthy? The answer: “A reasonable estimate would be tens of thousands.”\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "On the other hand, states that have strong economies can afford to spend more on K–12 education, so the strong economy could be causing the education spending. Or, education spending could boost economic growth, which makes possible additional education spending—the causality could be going in both ways. The point is that we should not use explanatory variables that might be affected by the outcome that we are trying to explain, or else the results will become hopelessly tangled. For example, it would be inappropriate to use the unemployment rate in a regression equation explaining GDP growth, since unemployment is clearly affected by the rate of GDP growth.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "We should have reason to believe that our explanatory variables affect the dependent variable, and not the other way around.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "The bigger concern should be whether or not the SAT is “coachable.” How much can students improve their scores by taking private\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "SAT prep classes? Wealthy families clearly are better able to send their children to test prep classes. Any causal improvement between these classes and SAT scores would favor students from wealthy families relative to more disadvantaged students of equal abilities (who presumably also could have raised their scores with a prep class but never had that opportunity).\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "Highly correlated explanatory variables (multicollinearity) . If a regression equation includes two or more explanatory variables that are highly correlated with each other, the analysis will not necessarily be able to discern the true relationship between each of those variables and the outcome that we are trying to explain\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "We are unlikely to get meaningful coefficients on either the cocaine or the heroin variable; we may also obscure the larger and more important relationship between SAT scores and using either one of these drugs. When two explanatory variables are highly correlated, researchers will usually use one or the other in the regression equation, or they may create some kind of composite variable, such as “used cocaine or heroin.”\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "This phenomenon can plague even legitimate research. The accepted convention is to reject a null hypothesis when we observe something that would happen by chance only 1 in 20 times or less if the null hypothesis were true. Of course, if we conduct 20 studies, or if we include 20 junk variables in a single regression equation, then on average we will get 1 bogus statistically significant finding. The New York Times Magazine captured this tension wonderfully in a quotation from Richard Peto, a medical statistician and epidemiologist: “Epidemiology is so beautiful and provides such an important perspective on human life and death, but an incredible amount of rubbish is published\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "Journal ran a front-page story on what it described as one of the “dirty little secrets” of medical research: “Most results, including those that appear in top-flight peer-reviewed journals, can’t be reproduced.” 7 (A peer-reviewed journal is a publication in which studies and articles are reviewed for methodological soundness by other experts in the same field before being approved for publication; such publications are considered to be the gatekeepers for academic research.) One reason for this “dirty little secret” is the positive publication bias described in Chapter 7. If researchers and medical journals pay attention to positive findings and ignore negative findings, then they may well publish the one study that finds a drug effective and ignore the nineteen in which it has no effect. Some clinical trials may also have small samples (such as for a rare diseases), which magnifies the chances t\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "First, designing a good regression equation—figuring out what variables should be examined and where the data should come from—is more important than the underlying statistical calculations. This process is referred to as estimating the equation, or specifying a good regression equation. The best researchers are the ones who can think logically about what variables ought to be included in a regression equation, what might be missing, and how the eventual results can and should be interpreted. Second, like most other statistical inference, regression analysis builds only a circumstantial case. An association between two variables is like a fingerprint at the scene of the crime. It points us in the right direction, but it’s rarely enough to convict. (And sometimes a fingerprint at the scene of a crime doesn’t belong to the perpetrator.) Any regression analysis needs a theoretical underpinning:\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "Welcome to program evaluation, which is the process by which we seek to measure the causal effect of some intervention—anything from a new cancer drug to a job placement program for high school dropouts. Or putting more police officers on the street. The intervention that we care about is typically called the “treatment,” though that word is used more expansively in a statistical context than in normal parlance\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "The point is that we are seeking to isolate the effect of that single factor; ideally we would like to know how the group receiving that treatment fares compared with some other group whose members are identical in all other respects but for the treatment. Program evalu\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015", "Here is how Jonathan Klick and Alexander Tabarrok, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University, respectively, studied how putting more police officers on the street affects the crime rate. Their research strategy made use of the terrorism alert system. Specifically, Washington, D.C., responds to “high alert” days for terrorism by putting more officers in certain areas of the city, since the capital is a natural terrorism target. We can assume that there is no relationship between street crime and the terrorism threat, so this boost in the D.C. police presence is unrelated to the conventional crime rate, or “exogenous.” The researchers’ most valuable insight was recognizing the natural experiment here: What happens to ordinary crime on terrorism “high alert” days? The answer: The number of crimes committed when the terrorism threat was Orange (high alert and more police) was roughly 7 percent lower than when the terrorism threat level was Yellow (elevated alert but no extra law enforcement precautions). The authors also found that the decrease in crime was sharpest in the police district that gets the most police attention on high-alert days (because it includes the White House, the Capitol, and the National Mall). The important takeaway is that we can answer tricky but socially meaningful questions—we just have to be clever about it.\\n\\nJanuary 12, 2015"]
