It is the final destination of a path that starts when ideas spawn like mutations from a primordial ooze and traverse a long, perilous route from inception to fruition. Along the way, stronger ideas accumulate believers and momentum, and weaker ones fall to the wayside. There is no process by which to implement this evolution; its defining characteristic is its lack of process\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "The full sentence should read “focus on the user and all else will follow.” This means that we will always do what’s right for the user, and we trust that our smart creatives will figure out how to make money from it.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "This simple insight—that people downloading Earth might be interested in getting Toolbar as well—increased Toolbar’s user base significantly and generated lots of revenue, but there’s practically no way Jonathan could have anticipated it when he stood before the board that day. Looking back, we realize the correct answer would have been, “I have no idea… but I’m sure we’ll figure it out.” Focus on the user… and the money will follow.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "At Google, our users are the people who use our products, while our customers are the companies that buy our advertising...Our bias is towards the user. It has to be this way, regardless of your industry. Users are more empowered than ever, and won’t tolerate crummy products.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "It can also be easier to take on big problems because bigger challenges attract big talent. There is a symbiotic relationship between big challenges and highly smart, skilled people: The challenges get solved and the people get happy. Give the wrong people a big challenge, and you’ll induce anxiety. But give it to the right people, and you’ll induce joy.170 They enjoy rising to the challenge for the sake of it, but also, as sociologist and management guru Rosabeth Moss Kanter has pointed out, for the very real benefits it can bring: new skills, new connections with colleagues in the field, enhanced reputation—what economists would describe as investing in their human capital.171 For these reasons, thinking big is actually a very powerful tool for attracting and retaining smart creatives. Put it this way: Let’s assume you are a brilliant smart creative just graduating from college\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "The best OKRs are aggressive, but realistic. Under this strange arithmetic, a score of 70 percent on a well-constructed OKR is often better than 100 percent on a lesser one.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "And there’s one final benefit of an OKR-driven culture: It helps keep people from chasing competitors. Competitors are everywhere in the Internet Century, and chasing them (as we noted earlier) is the fastest path to mediocrity. If employees are focused on a well-conceived set of OKRs,\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "70/20/10 became our rule for resource allocation: 70 percent of resources dedicated to the core business, 20 percent on emerging, and 10 percent on new.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "Ten percent also works because creativity loves constraints. It’s why pictures have frames and sonnets have fourteen lines. It’s why Henry Ford set pricing for his cars so low, because he knew that “We make more discoveries concerning manufacturing and selling under this forced method than by any method of leisurely investigation”. A lack of resources forces ingenuity.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "The first step toward bringing a good idea to fruition is to build a team of people who are committed to it, and while we may be clueless, your peers probably are not. Our constant advice to anyone who wants to launch a 20 percent project is to start by building a prototype, because that’s how you get people excited about the project. Coming up with an idea is pretty easy. Getting a few of your colleagues to join your project and add their 20 percent time to your 20 percent time is a lot harder. This is where the Darwinian process begins.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "One of our search teams tries to circumvent this through a program called “demo days.” The concept is pretty simple: A team spends a week building prototypes of new ideas that they will be expected to demo by the end of the week. Before the week starts, the engineers clear their calendars of all meetings and launches, no exceptions. This not only makes the demo days logistically possible, it serves as a forcing function to get everyone to commit. Since some people may be expected to work in unfamiliar areas, they can get training in the systems they may want to use. All systems are set up and ready to go...\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "no teams of one are allowed—and are encouraged to collaborate with people they don’t normally work with on a daily basis. Then the week starts and they get on it.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "The most valuable result of 20 percent time isn’t the products and features that get created, it’s the things that people learn when they try something new. Most 20 percent projects require people to practice or develop skills outside of those they use on a day-to-day basis, often collaborating with colleagues they don’t regularly work with. Even if these projects rarely yield some new, wow innovation, they always yield smarter smart creatives. As Urs Hölzle likes to point out, 20 percent time may be the best educational program a company can have.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "Create a product, ship it, see how it does, design and implement improvements, and push it back out. Ship and iterate. The companies that are the fastest at this process will win.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "To innovate, you must learn to fail well. Learn from your mistakes: Any failed project should yield valuable technical, user, and market insights that can help inform the next effort. Morph ideas, don’t kill them: Most of the world’s great innovations started out with entirely different applications, so when you end a project, look carefully at its components to see how they might be reapplied\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "We don’t provide any monetary incentive for 20 percent projects for the simple reason that we don’t need to: It may sound corny, but the reward comes from the work itself. Several studies have shown that extrinsic rewards don’t encourage creativity, and in fact hinder it, by turning an inherently rewarding endeavor into a money-earning chore\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "ongoing companies there are always hard questions, and they often don’t get asked because there aren’t any good answers and that makes people uncomfortable.\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014", "Start by asking what could be true in five years. Larry Page often says that the job of a CEO is not only to think about the core business, but also the future; most companies fail because they get too comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. And that is especially fatal today, when technology-driven change is rampant. So the question to ask isn’t what will be true, but what could be true. Asking what will be true entails making a prediction, which is folly in a fast-moving world. Asking what could be true entails imagination: What thing that is unimaginable when abiding by conventional wisdom is in fact imaginable?\\n\\nOctober 27, 2014"]
