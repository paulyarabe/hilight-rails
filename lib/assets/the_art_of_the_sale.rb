book_notes = ["The effects of this omission are grave. Many supposedly well-educated people in the business world are clueless about one of its most vital functions, the means by which you actually generate revenue. The absence of knowledge about sales has opened a class division between salespeople and the rest of business. Salespeople are often seen as operating by different rules and needing different motivators from other employees. They need conventions in Las Vegas and complex commission structures. They need to be goaded to perform and reined in when they sell too hard. They are patronized as “feet on the street” by those who prefer to imagine that business can be conducted by consultants with dueling PowerPoint presentations.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "in a properly functioning democracy, no matter the condition of your birth, if you can sell, you can slice through any obstacles of class, status, or upbringing in a way inconceivable in more hidebound societies. Great salesmen need no other prop to succeed. Selling well, in this view, is also a reflection of a healthy character.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "opposing view can be found in Death of a Salesman , Arthur Miller’s brutal portrait of a man crushed by the demands of capitalism, living out the last pathetic day of his life. Willy Loman is defeated by his work as a door-to-door salesman and by his failure to achieve the hollow dreams he has set for himself. For him, selling is a form of humiliation, an offense against human dignity perpetrated for the vile purpose of commercial gain. It is capitalism at its absolute worst.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "To excel at sales means you possess a power over people that can easily be misused.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "There was the man in a Hawaiian shirt who sold me a car a couple of years ago, who laughed and chatted his way through the paperwork, dispelling every mite of my buyer’s suspicion, asking me about my family, talking about his, building rapport in a way so “sales-y” and yet so much more pleasant than most of my other human interactions that day or week.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "Acting is a survival mechanism, it’s a social unguent, a lubricant. And we act to save our lives actually every day. People lie constantly every day by not saying something that they think, saying something that they don’t think, or showing something that they don’t feel.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "We come to know if people believe in us or find us phony. Ideally we believe in what we sell, but often we need to act, to put on a show, maybe even conceal the truth.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "But what really occurs when one person faces another and persuades him to buy? How do salespeople deal with the rejection inherent in selling, the unremitting no’s interspersed with the occasional, ecstatic yes? How do salespeople go from meeting to meeting making the same pitch, hearing the same depressing objections, and yet keep their spirits up? When we sell we are forced to confront the truth about ourselves. What we are willing to do for a buck: the way we present ourselves to different people in different settings to different ends; the extent to which we mix our personal with our professional relationships.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "Success consists of going from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm. WINSTON CHURCHILL\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "“What makes me different from others is that there is a story behind every object in my window,” he said. “I never studied beautiful things, but I studied the best of other people’s theories about beautiful things. So I know how to deal with wealthy customers, whether it’s the Rolling Stones or Catherine Deneuve or John Malkovich, Bob Dylan or Elizabeth Taylor. I remember I knew Elizabeth Taylor was coming and I brought my camera, but then I forgot to take a picture of her because I was consumed by the moment of explaining everything in my store.” Through presentation and storytelling, and understanding the desires of his customers, he could create value and set prices beyond the dreams of his neighbors in the souk.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "You judge a good salesman when he buys. The profit is not when you sell, it’s when you buy. You make a profit the moment you buy. Only losers wait till they sell to make a profit.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "As a salesman, you look at everyone,” Majid told me. “You pay attention. But often customers don’t even look at salespeople. They treat them like dirt. But if you stand there and watch and listen, you can learn a lot about a customer. I tend to leave people alone to look at things. I turn the lights on, pay attention to what they’re looking at, but I don’t hassle them. The salesman who interrupts and waves his hands about has another twenty years of learning to do.”\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "Customers come into my store with all these stories and warnings in their heads, fears that they’re going to be ripped off.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "We will see it repeatedly among great salespeople, this acceptance of rejection and failure as essential to building the muscles necessary for eventual success. They do not avoid rejection, but see it as a vaccine that strengthens their ability to resist the personal battering inevitable in a life in sales.\\n\\nDecember 28, 2017", "First the salesman lets you look. But the moment you express even the slightest interest, the rugs or objects are all over the floor. “Just to look, just to look,” says the salesman as you shrink back. Then he says, “Tell me which one you like.” It’s exactly the same trick used by American life insurance salesmen, avoiding questions that might elicit the answer no. You might say, “I’m not buying,” to which the salesmen will reply, “Just one you like, just tell me one.” If at any point you say, “How much?” you are hooked. Then it’s, “For you I give a special price. I can tell you’re a good guy.” If now you don’t buy, the salesman ramps up the emotional pressure.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2017", "He adores what he sells, which is evident from the care with which every object in his store is presented.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2017", "Declarative knowledge is knowing that something is the case, as opposed to procedural knowledge, which relates to how to do something. It is the diagnosis that precedes treatment. Salespeople in fast-moving situations must be able to assess customers and their wants before deciding how to approach them. This is one of the hardest things to teach. It requires good instincts and the ability to read people quickly. It is both the most animal skill in sales, and the most sophisticated.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2017", "He wanted a rug for his home in Houston, and he wanted the very best. Majid immediately perceived that by “best,” the man meant “the most expensive.” Majid decided to toy with him. He did indeed have some very expensive rugs, but he was not sure they would be what the man had in mind. The customer began to slaver. “Yes, that’s exactly what I want.” Appearing reluctant, Majid took him up to see a selection of rugs. He pointed out one, which, he said apologetically, was extremely expensive. “That’s the one,” the man said, and paid for it on the spot. Had Majid taken “best” to mean\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "the finest, he might have wasted time treating the customer as a true rug connoisseur. But the declarative knowledge derived from his experience allowed him to cut to the chase. This customer equated quality with price and wanted more than anything to tell visitors to his home that he had bought the best rug in Morocco, at a price to prove it.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "system of advanced pattern recognition. “In essence,” Szymanski writes, “the salesperson must engage in a qualification process at each stage. For instance, when initially confronted with a sales lead, the salesperson must decide whether the subject should be classified as a prospect or a suspect (a person or organization unlikely to purchase the good).” Once classified as a prospect, the lead must be evaluated further. Will he buy a lot or a little? Is price going to be an issue or not? Will he be able to close immediately, or will he need time to talk it over with others? At each step, the salesperson must try to maximize the return on their investment of selling effort. Their success will depend on the accuracy of their classification at every step of the sale.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "Sometimes you need to teach, to establish your authority with customers who take you for a mere peddler.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "Sullivan arrived early in the morning and spent a couple of hours erecting the metal stand and laying out the stacks of T-shirts. Then, shortly before the market opened, a man pulled up opposite him in a brown Volvo wagon. He took out a folding table and a few small contraptions. After drinking a cup of tea, he began his pitch for the amazing Washmatic: “It gives your car a shower rather than a bath!” Sullivan sat at Clamp’s stand and sold a few T-shirts all day. The man opposite him was drawing in crowds and selling four or five Washmatics every seven or eight minutes. “He had no different sizes, one color, one SKU [stock-keeping unit code],” says Sullivan. “And he did it all from one folding table. He made £500 in a day. I made £50. The difference was he was pitching, and I was just sitting there waiting for customers.”\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "The purpose of the pitch is to put a crowd “under the ether,” Sullivan explains. It is about telling an irresistible story. “Ray Charles used to say that people like country music because of the stories. It’s the same with products.” You want your audience so enraptured that when you say, “Who wants one?” there is simply no other possible answer besides “I do.” It all begins with a seemingly casual, friendly conversation with the first person who approaches you. “Good morning, mate, where have you come from? Bristol? I was just up there …” Then the moment the person looks at your product, you slide into the pitch. “You want me to show you how it works? You got a minute? Well you take your bucket of water …” This first person is your “number one.” Number one has to stand there for the length of the pitch. You’ve got to keep number one. But then as number two approaches, you can make eye contact and perhaps slip in a personal question. “Where you from? Bristol as well? How about that? This? You want to know about this? It’s like giving your car a shower instead of a bath.” As he talks, Sullivan moves his hands like a man directing traffic. “It’s a hypnotic thing you do with your hands, so their eyes follow them around. You also do a lot of nodding. I get people to agree with me a lot.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "same as when a teacher shouts ‘Listen!’ in class—everyone listens. Sometimes I’ll just shout out in the middle of the pitch, ‘Look,’ ‘Listen,’ ‘Watch.’” However long or short the pitch, its basic rhythms never change. “You keep bringing it back. Let’s just recap. You never put your hands down.” Then once he has everyone under the ether, it’s time to close, by creating a sense of great value and scarcity. “Come on in,” he’ll say, taking a step backward, which makes his audience step toward him. “Not $40, not $30, but just $19.95 for one mop and three extra heads. I can do this for five people. Who’ll be number one?” He puts his own hand up first and others quickly follow. He never uses the word “buy.” Sullivan says he has had fights break out for his $20 mops. “All there is to selling is to be likable, to share a joke, be a good storyteller. It’s like when you’ve been on a great holiday and you’re talking to a friend and you tell them ‘You’ve got to go to Vail. And when you do, you have to go to Russell’s and Terra Bistro and there’s a bartender who’ll set you up.’ It’s the same thing.”\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "But even if the products didn’t always work, it didn’t mean it wasn’t worth buying them for the story. I’d be disappointed when things didn’t work, but at least I hadn’t bought a piece of land or the Eiffel Tower\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "Sullivan is a strong believer in the “natural ability” theory of sales. “I have people who work with me who know everything about sales, but they still couldn’t sell. They don’t have what it takes. And then I’ve watched kids on YouTube who make fake infomercials and they’re getting millions of views.” He has read The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and attended a Tony Robbins convention, but finds them superficial. “They get you all fired up, but you fall back into your old ways pretty soon. When you get into a bar fight, you revert to what comes naturally, the old-fashioned tactics.”\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "It scares me that the basic health of the economy is measured in terms of consumer spending. On Black Friday, you have people driving into Wal-Mart to buy things they don’t need. We’ve become obsessed with stuff. You get these young salesmen who think they can sell anything, and in sectors like financial services they’re selling things with a very negative impact on people’s lives. They’re selling crappy product with no accountability.” But, come on. The Turbo Snake? “I’ve been called a huckster, a snake-oil salesman, everything. But now more than ever, if a product doesn’t work, or people don’t think they’re getting value, they can destroy your reputation online. It’s easy. If that happened to me, I wouldn’t still be in business\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "He resents the fact that when people hear the word salesman they think of the fast-talking closer, “the guy who didn’t go to law school or medical school, who took a job at the car dealership because he had to.” Much more respect is given to marketers.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "Everything’s so compartmentalized these days. Newscasters all look the same. Cars look the same. We get bombarded by the norm—so the question is how do you break through? I don’t care if you don’t like my message, just don’t ignore it.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "Stories serve two purposes in sales. They enable a salesperson to sell to a customer, and they enable salespeople to sell themselves on the value of their work.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "good story works in three stages, which resemble those of the sales process itself. The first involves getting your audience’s attention with an event or challenge that throws them off balance. Their everyday routines are upended and a problem now stands in their way. You make the audience feel a sense of crisis and crave an answer. The second stage consists of the struggle to solve the problem or overcome the enemy—human, emotional, or practical. The last step is resolution, a galvanizing moment that compels your audience to take action. These are the same stages Aristotle prescribed for tragedy in the Poetics : an inciting incident, a climactic struggle, and, finally, a resolution.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "The key to galvanizing your audience with a good story is to make listeners feel that they can be heroic. When good salespeople prospect and pitch, they must be alert to the stories running through their customers’ minds. What is their internal hero story? What do they wish to achieve through this sale? Whom do they wish to impress? What kind of person do they hope this sale will help them become? A sales manager seeking to motivate his salespeople must ask similar questions. What do salespeople really want from their work? And how can you enable them to live their heroic fantasy?\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "If he could have one professional wish come true, he said, it would be this: “that my employees would relate to people not as a customer with an employee, but as two human beings talking to one another. Not Mr. Black Jack Dealer to Black Jack player, but as Louise with Mr. Jones. If somehow we could harness that energy, we could change the history of the enterprise and achieve total market dominance in any service business in the world.” Is it actually possible to scale up the attentiveness of that one housekeeper to an entire organization employing thousands? Could you, as he put it, create a situation where your employees, left alone with a customer, with no management supervision, could find a way to deliver service that made them feel instantly gratified? Threatening punishment or offering financial incentives in a systematic way was difficult without an impossibly high level of monitoring. The only way would be to make an employee want to deliver this extraordinary level of service for reasons that they found personally fulfilling.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "These are the lowest ranks in the firm, the staff who deal with customers, and their immediate supervisors. The supervisors begin the meetings with the question “Anything happen yesterday that’s interesting?” Slowly, the hands go up...Another man was helping a couple who had just arrived and realized they had left their medication at home in Encino, just outside Los Angeles, a five-hour drive away. They were panicking and thought they were going to have to cancel their vacation and go home. No problem, the man said...He told the couple to instruct their housekeeper that a man named Ramirez would be coming to pick up their medication...The medication was with the couple before morning. And their loyalty to Wynn Resorts was likely guaranteed forever...Now, says Wynn, every member of staff wants their story on the wall. “Everyone goes to work looking for a goddamn story the next day,” said Wynn. “It is pristine, it is simple, it is profoundly effective”\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "Clotaire Rapaille, a French psychologist who has worked for many of the world’s largest corporations, describes successful salespeople as “happy losers.” They see each rejection as a step on the way to a win. They yearn to see themselves on a classic hero’s journey, using rejection as a means to personal transformation\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "That first “no” can go two ways. In some it leads to fear and a dislike of the activity in question. In the future salesmen, it makes them want to find a way to “yes.” At several of the companies Rapaille has worked with, he has held weekly meetings with salespeople and asked them how many no’s they received that week. He found that the more no’s a salesperson received the more money they made. The no’s were an indication of effort and creativity. The salespeople with more no’s were making more calls, trying new things, making more mistakes. Not only did it indicate resilience in the face of rejection, it showed willingness to take each acceptance to its absolute limit.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "When firms hire salespeople, Rapaille recommends, they should be looking for this willingness to fail rather than a track record of successful selling. They should ask, “How many things did you try in your life that you failed at?” If someone says they have only ever tasted success, it suggests they have lived a very sheltered life and will soon crumple under the personal assault inevitable in any sales job.\\n\\nDecember 31, 2017", "At its most basic and technical, selling is about understanding a customer’s needs and delivering a product to meet them. There are three pieces to this. The first is economic: what the customer is willing to pay and the price at which you are willing to sell. The second is structural, to do with the process of selling. A quick, one-off sale in a store is very different from a months-long sale to a company, where you have to deal with numerous people in various stages. The final piece is psychological: the battle of wits, personality, and emotion between the seller and buyer.\\n\\nDecember 31, 201"]
