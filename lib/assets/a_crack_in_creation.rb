book_notes = ["Science does not know its debt to imagination. —Ralph Waldo Emerson\\n\\nJune 7, 2018", "Because CRISPR allows precise and relatively straightforward DNA editing, it has transformed every genetic disease—at least, every disease for which we know the underlying mutation(s)—into a potentially treatable target.\\n\\nJune 18, 2018", "Assuming gene editing in humans proves to be safe and effective, it might seem logical, even preferable, to correct disease-causing mutations at the earliest possible stage of life, before harmful genes begin wreaking havoc. Yet once it becomes feasible to transform an embryo’s mutated genes into “normal” ones, there will certainly be temptations to upgrade normal genes to supposedly superior versions. Should we begin editing genes in unborn children to lower their lifetime risk of heart disease, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, or cancer? What about endowing unborn children with beneficial traits, like greater strength and increased cognitive abilities, or changing physical traits, like eye and hair color? The quest for perfection seems almost intrinsic to human nature, but if we start down this slippery slope, we may not like where we end up.\\n\\nJune 18, 2018", "modern humans’ existence, the Homo sapiens genome has been shaped by the twin forces of random mutation and natural selection. Now, for the first time ever, we possess the ability to edit not only the DNA of every living human but also the DNA of future generations\\n\\nJune 18, 2018", "What will we, a fractious species whose members can’t agree on much, choose to do with this awesome power?\\n\\nJune 18, 2018", "our work had initially been motivated by curiosity about an entirely unrelated subject: the way that bacteria defend themselves against viral infection. Yet in the course of our research on a bacterial immune system called CRISPR-Cas, we uncovered the workings of an incredible molecular machine that could slice apart viral DNA with exquisite precision. The utility of this same machine to perform DNA manipulations in other kinds of cells, including human cells, was immediately clear to us.\\n\\nJune 18, 2018", "Some people view any form of genetic manipulation as heinous, a perverse violation of the sacred laws of nature and the dignity of life. Others see the genome simply as software—something we can fix, clean, update, and upgrade—and argue that leaving human beings at the mercy of faulty genetics is not only irrational, but immoral.\\n\\nJune 18, 2018", "Sickle cell disease is an example of a recessive genetic disease. This means that both copies of an individual’s HBB gene must carry the mutation for that person to be affected; if only one copy has the alteration, the nonmutated gene can produce enough normal hemoglobin to overcome the negative effects of the mutated hemoglobin. People with only one mutated copy of the HBB gene are still carriers of the sickle cell trait, however, and while they’re usually unaffected, they can still pass the mutated gene on to their offspring.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "Other genetic diseases exhibit dominant inheritance, meaning that just a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disease.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "WHIM syndrome, in which the one thousandth letter of the CXCR4 gene is mutated from a C to a T; the mutant gene creates a hyperactive protein that dominates the functioning of the healthy gene.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "Scientists have precisely identified well over four thousand different kinds of DNA mutations that can cause genetic disease.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "Inspired in part by the uncanny ability of viruses to splice new genetic information into the DNA of bacterial cells, the pioneers of this early gene therapy realized they could use viruses to deliver therapeutic genes to humans.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "Later research would demonstrate that, in contrast to Rogers’s theory, the Shope virus didn’t even contain an arginase gene and so would not have been useful for treating hyperargininemia in the first place. Although Rogers would never attempt gene therapy again, his approach of using viruses as gene-delivery vehicles—vectors, as scientists call them—revolutionized the field of biology. The experiment failed, but its basic premise proved solid, and viral vectors are still one of the most effective ways we know to insert genes into a cell’s genome and, thus, alter the genetic code of living organisms.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "For these and many other hard-to-treat genetic diseases, what doctors really needed was a way to repair problematic genes, not just supplant them. If they could fix the defective code that caused the issue, they could target recessive and dominant diseases alike without ever having to worry about the consequences of splicing a gene into the wrong place.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "scientists could deliver genes more gently, without using viruses to ram new DNA into the genome. By tricking a cell into thinking that the recombinant DNA was simply an extra chromosome that needed to be paired with a matching gene already in its genome, scientists could ensure that the new DNA was combined with the existing, native genetic code through homologous recombination. Scientists dubbed this new approach to gene manipulation gene targeting. Today, we know it by another name: gene editing.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "Perhaps its biggest drawback was the problem of nonhomologous recombination, or illegitimate recombination, in which the new DNA was haphazardly integrated into the genome rather than accurately delivered to its matching sequence. In fact, illegitimate recombination seemed to prevail over homologous recombination by a factor of about a hundred to one. Clearly, therapeutic use wasn’t very promising if gene editing could correct a mutated gene in only 1 percent of transformed cells while randomly splicing DNA into the genome in the other 99 percent.\\n\\nJune 19, 2018", "I skimmed several of the background articles, reading just enough to learn that this thing—CRISPR—referred to a region of bacterial DNA and that the acronym stood for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.” I didn’t read any further, stymied by the jargon and figuring that Jill would fill me in when we met.\\n\\nJune 22, 2018", "Research scientists are fueled by adventurousness, curiosity, instinct, and grit—but we need a healthy sense of practicality in addition to these loftier traits. There are the banalities of funding to consider and management requirements galore. Those of us who run our own labs need to delegate to other scientists many of the tasks we were trained to do ourselves. Often, this means selecting the right person to lead the charge whenever we enter a brand-new field of research.\\n\\nJune 23, 201"]
