book_notes = ["A few doors down the hall of the dingy office building was the doctor’s waiting room, a closet-sized space with four folding chairs, no table, no magazines, and nothing on the gray walls except a detailed chart showing precisely how much Dr. Tamalet would charge, and how much the national insurance plan would reimburse, for each form of treatment. My visit, a “consultation for joint pain or stiffness,” was priced at €26, or $33.80. Patients were expected to pay this fee at the time of the visit, and the insurance would reimburse the patient about 70 percent of the fee, or $24. In other words, a visit to an orthopedic specialist would cost about $10 out of pocket. Back home, a “consultation for joint pain and stiffness” would cost me roughly four times as much—and considerably more if my insurance company denied the claim and stuck me with the whole bill.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2019", "Whether or not you agree with the World Health Organization’s conclusion that France has the world’s No. 1 health care system, all the statistics on national health suggest that France rates near the top of the global rankings. France does a better job than almost any other country both in encouraging health and in treating those who get sick. As noted earlier, France has the best performance of any nation on a key measure, “Mortality Amenable to Health Care”—which is to say, the French medical system does the best job of curing people whose diseases are curable.2 The French rank near the top—and sharply higher than the United States—on standard health measures like Disability-Adjusted Life Expectancy (DALE), infant mortality, and life expectancy among adults. (An average sixty-year-old Frenchwoman can expect to live in good health for a further twenty years and three months; a sixty-year-old American female will average another seventeen years and eleven months of healthy life.)3 The French health insurance system covers every resident of France and guarantees everyone a roughly equal level of treatment. France has more doctors per capita than the United States and more hospital beds. The French go to the doctor about eight times per year, on average, compared to five visits for Americans; the average Frenchman takes more pills and shots than Americans do. Continuing the tradition of doctors Péan and Latarjet, the French are significant innovators in health care and pharmaceuticals. In short, the French are big consumers of medicine, and they get a high-quality product.Yet France pays less than we do for health care.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "At the start of each consultation, the patient handed the doctor a green plastic credit card like this: This carte vitale—the “vital card,” or the “card of life”—contains the patient’s entire medical record, back to 1998. Embedded in the gold metallic square just left of center is a digital record of every doctor visit, referral, injection, operation, X-ray, diagnostic test, prescription, warning, etc., together with a report on how much the doctor billed for each visit and how much was paid, by the insurance funds and by the patient. Everybody in France over age fifteen has this card—a child’s medical records are maintained on his mother’s card—and it is the secret weapon that makes French medical care so much more efficient than anything Americans are used to. When Dr. Bonnaud receives the carte vitale from his patient, he slides it into a small reader on top of his desk—it’s about the size of a desktop telephone—and the patient’s medical record is displayed on the doctor’s computer screen. That’s why French doctors and hospitals don’t need to maintain file cabinets full of records. It’s all digitized. It’s all on the card. As Dr. Bonnaud considers his patient’s symptoms and proposes a remedy—a shot, a course of drugs, a referral to a specialist, a good night’s sleep, whatever—he types in a record of the visit and his treatment. That information is written to the patient’s carte vitale. If the patient is advised to go to the hospital or a specialist or a drugstore, he will take his carte vitale along with him, and on it the doctors there will find Dr. Bonnaud’s diagnosis and recommended treatment.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2019", "Because the medical information on that gold chip is encrypted, France’s Health Ministry insists that there have been no breaches of patient privacy.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2019", "But the greatest value of the carte vitale is its impact on the payment of medical bills. Each patient’s green card knows which sickness fund and which private health insurance plan (mutuelle) covers that patient. When Dr. Bonnaud finishes a consultation and enters that day’s treatment on the patient’s card, he stretches out the ring finger on his left hand and hits the “transmit” key on his computer. With that single keystroke, all billing information—how much the patient owed, how much he paid the doctor as a co-pay, how much each of the insurance plans should pay back to the doctor and the patient—is transmitted to each of the relevant insurance plans. With that single keystroke, the billing process is finished. “I will be paid,” Dr. Bonnaud told me, with total confidence, “in three days.” The insurance funds are required to pay him that fast, with no quibbles—and they do.\\n\\nDecember 27, 2019", "In addition to the certainty of the process and the resulting peace of mind, this national billing system creates major financial savings. No French doctor, hospital, or drugstore has to pay a “denial management” company to collect what is owed by the health insurance industry. The expensive layer of administrative workers and paper handlers found in every corner of American medicine doesn’t exist in France. Dr. Bonnaud told me that he and his partners would never consider hiring a secretary or office manager. “Why would I pay somebody to do my billing?” the doctor said. “C’est automatique.” Automatic payment also makes French hospitals, public and private, dramatically cheaper to run than any U.S. hospital. Although French hospitals generally have more doctors and nurses per patient than an American establishment, they have 67 percent fewer administrative personnel to keep track of paperwork and billing. “This difference in hospital staffing . . . reflects the difference between a National Health Insurance system and the U.S. health system, characterized by large numbers of administrative and clerical personnel whose main tasks focus on billing many hundreds of payers, documenting all medical procedures performed, and handling risk management and quality assurance activities,”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2019", "Why? Since the insurance funds will subsequently reimburse the patient for most, or often all, of the cost of medical care, why bother collecting the co-pay across the doctor’s desk each time? “Does it seem impractical?” Dr. Bonnaud responded when I asked him. “No, I think it is entirely reasonable. Medical care is a valuable commodity. Its value can be life or death. When we ask the patient to pay that €21 in my office, we remind her that she is receiving a costly service. Even though she’s going to get the money back from insurance in a week, maybe two, it is important to convey that something of value is exchanged when they come to see me. And maybe, if somebody calls me to their home just out of loneliness, just to have a chat, maybe that person will spare me the trip because he doesn’t want to pay the €31.”\\n\\nDecember 27, 2019", "“I will never be rich,” Dr. Bonnaud told me, sitting at the simple wooden desk in his cluttered office. “In the States, I would make much, much more. But there I would be fighting always the insurance companies over what I can prescribe, what I can do for my patients. Here, we have freedom to do the medicine we think is right. And the patient, any patient, can get the treatment needed; the insurance, or the social security, will pay for it. I will never be rich, but I can look in the mirror in the morning and know that I am doing the best for my patients. For a physician, that is a form of richness; it brings satisfaction.”\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Sometimes, doing the best for his patients means referring them to a specialist for further care. When Dr. Bonnaud saw my stiff, aching shoulder, he did just that: He sent me to Dr. Tamalet in Versailles. After Dr. Tamalet gave me that lecture on France’s glorious history of shoulder surgery, he took a close look at my X-rays. He questioned me carefully about the history of my shoulder problem, going back to the initial accident decades earlier. He manipulated my arm and shoulder to get a personal feel for the degree of damage within. And then he delivered his verdict: The smartest thing I could do, he concluded, would be a vigorous regime of physical therapy, to stretch and strengthen the muscular system in my shoulder. That would not eliminate all pain or restore full movement, but it would give me a freer, less painful joint without the risks of major surgery.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Now the sickness funds in Christina’s region are trying to put an absolute lid on expenditures for treatment. In her case, the insurance system pays her to see about seven hundred different patients per quarter. Although there are some mechanisms to get around the limit, this means essentially that she won’t be paid for treating the 701st patient who walks in the door.“I theoretically, I could stop after that point,” she told me,“and go on vacation for three weeks. Many doctors do, yes? But you don’t do it as a family doctor. If the patients [are] sick, you must treat. For that patient, you must be a doctor for no pay until the next quarter.”\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "To make up for the lost income, Dr. Christina has become an entrepreneur. She now offers a broad range of treatments and classes in cosmetic medicine, hair removal, liposuction, exercise techniques, etc., aimed primarily at working women like herself.A plaque on the white wall of the waiting room notes that Dr. Von Köckritz has obtained a Zertifikat am Intensivkurs Botulinumtoxin, which means she can offer Botox injections. She has installed an exercise machine—basically, a fancy treadmill—and she charges customers about $15 per half hour to use it. None of these services is covered by the basic health insurance plan—and that’s the beauty of them for Dr. Christina. She sets the fees herself for these treatments, receiving payment directly from the patients, and that income doesn’t count against the system’s “global budget.” “I must learn new things, a lot, to make money,” the doctor told me.“It is not what I thought I would do when I was in medical school. I cannot say I like it. But this is German medicine practice today.”\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "TO AN AMERICAN VISITING the country on a quest for a cure, German medicine practice today looks good. On a personal level, the German system was ready to handle my shoulder problem. Had I been a member of any sickness fund, I could have chosen to have the surgical solution, total shoulder arthroplasty, at a rock-bottom price, with no waiting. If that approach seemed too drastic, the German insurance plans would have paid for less radical remedies, like physical therapy or injections for pain.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Prices are low; as we’ll see, the Japanese system has a rigid cost-control mechanism that favors the patient, at the expense of doctors and hospitals. My out-of-pocket cost for an office visit with the prestigious Dr. Nakamichi in his prestigious clinic came to ¥2,060, or $19 (the doctor charged $64, and insurance pays 70 percent of the bill in Japan). Had I chosen to have the shoulder-replacement surgery in Tokyo, the total price—including five nights in the hospital—would have run about $10,000. That’s roughly one-fourth of what the operation would cost in the USA, assuming one night in the hospital.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "The Japanese love medical technology; they get twice as many CAT scans per capita as Americans do and three times as many MRI scans.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Japan lags, though, in terms of invasive surgery; Japanese patients are much less apt than Americans to have operations such as arthroplasty, transplant, or heart bypass. This is partly economics—since the fees for surgery are low, doctors don’t recommend it as often—and partly cultural. As a rule, Japanese doctors and patients prefer drugs to cutting the body. On a per-capita basis, the Japanese take about twice as many prescription drugs as Americans do.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "There’s a monthly limit on a patient’s payments, however; nobody has to pay more than about $650 in a month. If I had chosen that $10,000 arthroplasty at Keio Daigaku Hospital, it would have cost me roughly $650 out of pocket, and insurance would have paid the remainder of the bill. The insurance plans must accept everyone who applies, regardless of preexisiting conditions, and they must pay every bill submitted by a physician or a hospital. They can’t turn you down for coverage, and they can’t deny your claim.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "In the United States, a standard MRI scan of the head costs about $1,000 to $1,400. In Japan, the health ministry thinks that price is far too high. The fixed price for an MRI of the head in Japan is 11,400, or $105. That’s why Japan, with the highest per capita rate of MRI scans in the world, still spends less than most developed countries on health care; you can buy a lot of scans if the price is dirt-cheap. I once asked Professor Ikegami why doctors put up with this; why don’t they just refuse to take MRI scans if the fee is so low? “The answer to that is the Fee Schedule,” the economist replied.“There’s only one payment scale in Japan. If a doctor won’t accept the price in the schedule, he won’t get any business. And he won’t have the scans he needs to diagnose his patients.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "heavy-handed price control from above has had a salutary effect on the cost of medical care. Because the permitted fee for an MRI scan is so low, for example, Japanese doctors went to the MRI manufacturers—Hitachi, Toshiba, etc.—and demanded a new line of compact, inexpensive MRI machines. The industry responded. Today, Japanese doctors and clinics can buy MRI scanners for around $150,000—about one-tenth the price of the bigger machines used in the United States. That helps keep prices down for the Japanese health care system.And the new line of cheap, simple MRI machines has been an export boon for the Japanese manufacturers, giving them a lock on the MRI market in poorer countries. These cut-price models perform the basic scanning job but don’t have all the advanced features of top-of-the-line models generally used in the United States. So cost control not only keeps prices down; it also encourages innovation.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Still, there’s a long-term price to be paid for keeping providers’ prices low. Many Japanese hospitals today are severely underfunded. It is not just that they tend to be dumpy, gray concrete structures with sparse facilities and crowded spaces. Beyond that, the stiff cost-control regime limits the ability of doctors and private hospitals to incorporate expensive new techniques and equipment. The national association of private hospitals says that about 50 percent of hospitals and clinics in Japan are badly underfunded, with many on the verge of bankruptcy. Most of the innovation in Japanese medicine comes in the relatively small number of hospitals affiliated with major medical schools\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "“My job, you know, is to assess your medical problem,” he began, “decide whether you need a consultant, which kind of specialist, all that. And I could get you an appointment with an orthopod, a shoulder man. In your state—no acute problem—the wait will be two months, three months. And the consultant will look you over and say, ‘We don’t do shoulder arthroplasty in the NHS unless there’s a serious disability.You are living your normal life without much impairment. So it’s not indicated.’” Dr. Badat sort of chuckled at the thought of it. “And then you can come back here to my surgery.And then I can send you to another consultant if you want.Another two, three months.And that bloke will say the same thing.And then you come back here again, and I’ll tell you that you can get some physio [physical therapy] if you develop acute pain. Or you can get the operation privately and pay for it yourself. And that’s what’s going to happen in the NHS.” In other words, nothing was going to happen in the NHS. The operation that my American surgeon suggested without a moment’s hesitation was a nonstarter in the British system. This result was not totally crazy; other doctors, in the United States and around the world, had told me I might not be a good candidate for a procedure as drastic as a total shoulder arthroplasty. But in Britain, I had the feeling that it was the system, not my medical condition, that made the surgery “not indicated.”\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "That was precisely what happened with my bum shoulder. Canada was the only country on my global quest where the waiting list was so long that I never had a chance even to meet an orthopedist or a physical therapist. When I explained my shoulder problem to Dr. Steven Goluboff, a sympathetic general practitioner in Saskatoon, he agreed that I needed a specialist’s care. “I can give you a referral to an orthopod,” the doctor said.“But the frustrating thing is, it will take ten to twelve months before you can get an appointment.”“You mean, I’d have to wait a year to get my shoulder treated?” I asked. “Oh, I’m not talking about treatment,” Dr. Goluboff replied. “It will take a year for you to get a consultation. If the orthopedist decides you need surgery, you’ll have to wait another six months, eight months, to get that on the schedule.”\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "The waiting periods vary from province to province, and they vary according to the treatment you’re waiting for. Orthopedic surgery is notorious for long waiting lines across Canada; other backed-up procedures include MRI scans, cataract surgery, coronary bypass, and radiation treatments for cancer.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "it is virtually impossible to find private care in most of the country. A doctor or hospital that bills Medicare is not allowed to practice privately as well or bill patients directly. Since virtually every doctor in Canada relies on Medicare for his income, very few offer private treatment. That makes for a thoroughly egalitarian system, but there’s one major problem: A lot of medical care that people would be willing to pay for, if they were allowed to pay, is hard to get under Medicare. The issue is waiting lists. Yes, Canada’s Medicare system will replace my aching shoulder for free—but only if I wait a year for a consultation with an orthopedic specialist, then wait another six months or so to get a spot in the operating room. If my shoulder really hurts, I may not want to wait eighteen months for the public system to get around to me. But under the law, I have no choice. Even if I have enough money or private insurance coverage, I can’t buy immediate care. Some argue that the ban on paying privately for a given procedure is tantamount to a ban on that procedure altogether—that access to a waiting list is not the same thing as access to treatment.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "This argument came to a head in a blockbuster Canadian Supreme Court decision, a ruling that could threaten the very foundations of Medicare.A sixty-seven-year-old citizen of Quebec was suffering from a painful hip condition; his physician, Dr. Jacques Chaoulli, recommended hip-replacement surgery. But that recommendation gave the patient nothing more than a place on the waiting list.After nine months had passed, Dr. Chaoulli went to court on behalf of his patient. He argued that a nine-month wait for an elderly man in severe pain amounted to denial of the right to medical care; thus the patient should be allowed to get the operation privately and bill his insurance company for the cost. To the astonishment of just about everybody, the Supreme Court agreed. “The prohibition on obtaining private health insurance,” said the court’s opinion in Chaoulli v. Quebec, “while it might be constitutional in circumstances where health care services are reasonable as to both quality and timeliness, is not constitutional where the public system fails to deliver reasonable services.”8 The Chaoulli decision came down in 2005, and many predicted that it would lead quickly to the dreaded two-tier medicine. That may eventually be the result, but so far it has not happened. Instead, the decision has jolted governments into providing more, and faster, care. The federal government and the provinces have agreed to spend more money, bring in more doctors, and reduce the waiting lists. “We’re not going to have a two-tier health care system in this country,” Prime Minister Paul Martin said after the decision.“What we want to do is to strengthen the public health care system.” Quebec’s provincial government responded to the Chaoulli case by setting specific time limits for the completion of hip-replacement and many other procedures.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Like almost every doctor in almost every country, Goluboff complains that he isn’t paid enough for his hard work; in fact, his income is about half as much as an American family doctor might expect to earn. Still, he drives a BMW convertible and belongs to the town’s leading country club. And Canada’s system gives him certain advantages that American doctors would envy. He carries malpractice insurance but has no idea how much it costs, because the provincial government pays the premium for him. His office has no file cases full of patient records, because Canada’s coordinated system has made all medical records digital. He never has to deal with money. Patients pay nothing to see him; the provincial Medicare office pays all his fees at the end of each month. The tuition costs for a medical degree run about half what they would be at a public university in the United States, so Canadian doctors start their careers with far less debt than their counterparts south of the border.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "One thirtysomething woman, pierced and tattooed and smelling vividly of perspiration and tobacco, told the doctor that she had been living “pretty much on the street” after her boyfriend threw her out for drinking too much. She had no job, no money. She hadn’t been to a doctor in years. But she was feeling “kind of punk,” she said; she didn’t feel like eating; her side ached. Dr. Goluboff extended his hand and gently pressed the right side of her abdomen; the woman jumped back, wincing with pain. Within seconds, Goluboff was on the phone to the emergency ward.“I think we’ve got an acute appy here,” he said. “I’ll put her in an ambulance and get her over there in twenty minutes.” Now the woman was worried: “Hospital? Ambulance? Do they expect me to pay for that?” “No,” the doctor replied, “you don’t have to pay for anything. We’re going to fix you up—probably remove your appendix, which you don’t need anyway. And of course, we’re not going to charge you for it.”\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "The most distinctive lesson we could take, though, from Canada’s health care system is the key point of the Tommy Douglas saga: A national solution to a nation’s health care problems doesn’t have to start at the national level. Once Douglas established free hospital care in a poor rural province and made it work, the demonstration effect drove other provinces to do the same thing. And once Douglas established his taxpayer-funded Medicare system to pay all medical bills in the province, the demonstration effect quickly turned Saskatchewan’s idea into a national health care system.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "The sweetest part of Indian medicine came three times a day, when I lay down for an oil massage at the hands of my strong, skillful therapists, Vinodh and Balu. Like a chicken being readied for the rotisserie, I was stretched on a long black slab of neem wood and marinated in a warm sesame oil laced with forty-six herbs and medications. (The formula for this oil was first set down about 500 BC in a work called the Ashtanga Hridayam. Ayurvedic pharmacists have stuck to that ancient recipe ever since.) Vinodh would chant a prayer to Dhanwanthari and then start in, working meticulously on every oiled limb and every muscle in my body. He massaged every finger and every toe; he cracked every knuckle; he massaged my eyelids and earlobes. He used long, powerful strokes that moved smoothly from my right shoulder to my left heel and vice versa. As those strong hands flowed over me, I could almost feel the blocked channels in my body opening up to release the flow of prana. This full-body workout, known as abhyangam, was followed by a localized massage, or pizhichil, of my bad shoulder, using even warmer oil and even stronger massage. While Balu dripped the medicated oil over my joint, Vinodh’s forceful fingers would go to work.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "These daily rubdowns left the patient feeling marvelous—but they also left me drenched in oil from hair to soles. The solution to that problem was almost as good as the massage.After the morning sessions, Vinodh would wash me all over with a soupy soap made of ground green beans. This ritual removed all the oil and left me smelling like a fresh legume straight from the garden. Each afternoon,Vinodh and Balu would return to my massage table for the strangest treatment of all, an ancient procedure called navarakizhi. One man would immerse fist-sized burlap bags filled with rice in a vat of boiling milk; then the other would use those heated rice bags to smite and knead my back and shoulder. Dr. Manohar told me that ancient scripture recommended navarakizhi as a way to revive debilitated muscle tissue. It sounded far-fetched, but so what? It felt great. In this stress-free, unhurried, low-cal way, I spent a few weeks undergoing Ayurvedic treatment at the chikitsalayam. As I got into the Ayurvedic life, I began wearing a dhoti, the Gandhi-style wrapound skirt for men. I reread the Bhagavad Gita several times. I could almost feel my doshas floating back into balance. And gradually, I began to realize that all this ancient medicine was working.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "For once, Dr. Manohar was silent. Dr. Hemalata, a youthful vaidya so petite she had to tilt her head upward just to look at my shoulder, started asking questions.“How is your pain?” she queried.“As a matter of fact,” I said,“I don’t have any pain in my shoulder. I began to notice that a few days ago. The pain I normally feel when I wake up is gone. My shoulder feels fine.”This moved Dr. Hemalata to a broad, satisfied smile, so pretty and so infectious that I started smiling, too. Then she took out Dr. Manohar’s stainless-steel medical protractor; she told me to raise my right arm as high as I could and measured the angle of rotation in my shoulder.“There is significant increase in range of motion,” she said, her smile growing even broader. “Your shoulder is greatly improved.” As if that weren’t good enough, the vaidyas then led me to a scale; under the relentless regimen of massage and the relentless diet of dal bhat, I had lost nine pounds in a matter of weeks. But even that stellar achievement paled compared to the obvious improvement in my frozen joint.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "So Taiwan built a system that uses private doctors and hospitals, with a single, government-run insurance plan to pay them. That’s national health insurance—which is to say, the Canadian model. But Hsiao insisted on one major break from the Canadian system: In Taiwan, National Health Insurance is not funded through general taxation; rather, the money people pay to finance the health insurance fund is called a premium. Both employer and employee are required to chip in monthly to pay this “premium.” For Hsiao, the nomenclature is important. Yes, there’s a mandatory payment for everybody. Yes, it’s withheld from pay and goes directly to the government. But this payment is not a tax. “You never want to call it a tax,” Hsiao says. “If you call it a national insurance premium, then you’re asking people to pay for a product, not to pay a tax to some huge government entity.”\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Meanwhile, high-tech Taiwan saw the carte vitale in France and decided to give all 23 million Taiwanese patients their own electronic card, with medical and billing records embedded on a chip. As in the Bismarck countries, Taiwan made health insurance mandatory for everybody—with government providing interest-free loans to help people who couldn’t pay the premium—and guaranteed that anybody, healthy or sick, would be covered. As in France and Japan, the government’s newly created Bureau of National Health Insurance was given central power to set the prices for medical services and drugs. And as in France and Japan, this has proven to be a powerful force in keeping prices low. Because the health insurance plan is run by the government and is thus highly responsive to political pressure,Taiwan’s plan covers just about every imaginable form of medical treatment, including physical, mental, dental, and optical, as well as organ transplants, acupuncture, Chinese massage, drugs, traditional herbal medicines, and long-term care.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "In most Taiwanese cities, medical clinics stay open twelve hours a day, seven days a week. The doctors don’t particularly like it, but they have to operate that way. After all, their competitors down the street are open for business. Chang Hong-Jen, the businessman who helped design the system—and later became the CEO of the Bureau of National Health Insurance—told me that “doctors in Taiwan work very, very hard, because they have to use volume to make up for the low fees.” The most striking result of Taiwan’s new system is a healthier population with a longer healthy life expectancy and much higher recovery rates from major diseases. This is particularly evident in rural areas, where it was difficult or impossible to see a doctor before the new system took place. In the fishing village of Jinshan, on a rocky shoreline along Taiwan’s east coast, the local government built a hospital at the turn of the twenty-first century. It was the first hospital Jinshan ever had, and it was possible only because National Health Insurance could pay the bills.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Indeed, the low rate of spending has emerged as the most serious problem facing Taiwanese health care in the second decade of the national system. Many clinics and hospitals are defaulting on bank loans and threatening to declare bankruptcy unless National Health Insurance agrees to pay higher fees. Since 2002, the Bureau of National Health Insurance—that is, the national government—has had to borrow from banks to pay its bills, because the politicians have been afraid to make their constituents pay higher premiums or co-pays. It seems almost certain that Taiwan will have to increase the health care premiums paid by workers and employers, and perhaps chip in money from general tax revenues to keep the medical providers afloat. In the end, Taiwan may have to pay as much as 8 percent of its GDP for its universal health care system.3 But even if it gets to that point,Taiwan will be at less than half the U.S. rate of health care spending—while providing coverage for everybody.\\n\\nDecember 29, 2019", "Those uncelebrated doctors who devote their talents to keeping large populations well sometimes look with envy at the stature and income of prizewinning medical researchers and highly paid physicians practicing one-on-one medical treatment. “The prestige of any given specialty within the house of medicine is inversely proportional to the size of the object it addresses,” wrote Dr. Ichiro Kawachi, of the Harvard School of Public Health. “Hence if your chosen field of specialty happens to deal with microscopic objects like chromosomes and genes, you can be assured of high prestige as well as unlimited access to funding. If, on the other hand, your chosen field happens to deal with the opposite end of the spectrum from genes—that is, the health of entire populations—then you had better resign yourself to a life of chronic under-funding, low prestige, and being ignored by the rest of the world.”\\n\\nDecember 30, 2019", "developed nations maintain a floor of basic coverage available to everyone, and a ceiling on the treatments the national system will pay for. The former British health minister John Reid put it succinctly: “We cover everybody, but not everything.” The United States differs from all the other developed nations in that it has no floor and no ceiling. For tens of millions of people, the American health care system offers little or no care (or no care until it is too late, as in the case of Nikki White). For people covered by top-of-the-line insurance plans, the U.S. system offers almost anything, regardless of the price or the patient’s age.\\n\\nDecember 30, 2019", "To put it simply, the United States does well when it comes to providing medical care, but has a rotten system for financing that care. We need a health care system that permits the strong facets of American medicine to flourish, makes their benefits accessible to everybody, and does it in a cost-efficient way. As we’ve seen, this is not impossible. All the other rich countries have found financing mechanisms that cover everybody and they still spend much less than we do. We’ve ignored those foreign models, partly because of “American exceptionalism”—the notion that the United States has nothing to learn from the rest of the world. In health care, at least, that old mind-set is clearly losing its sway. Americans are coming to realize that the other rich countries are getting more and better medicine, for less money, than we do.\\n\\nDecember 30, 201"]
