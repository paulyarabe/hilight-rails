book_notes = ["Duke Ellington was a widely acclaimed jazz composer, pianist, and big band leader, widely acknowledged as the most important composer in the history of jazz. He was brilliant at using the materials at his disposal to bring out the best in people, notice their unique voices, support their strengths, and create the conditions so that they could branch out and blossom. Ellington paid close attention to what players could do when they were at their best, how they played when they were doing well. He composed music specifically to match his players’ strengths, their unique personalities, and their unique voice and sounds.1 Ellington looked for distinctive voices in his band and deliberately sought out diversity in sound.", "Ellington created a vehicle for Williams to branch out and discover his own voice.", "Charles, I don’t fire musicians, so I must ask you to resign from my band", "I live for the nights that this band is great. I don’t think about the nights like what you’re worrying about. If you pay attention to these people, they will drive you crazy. They’re not going to drive me crazy.”33 Ellington’s decision to focus attention on the band when they were playing brilliantly is a precious skill and central to provocative competence", "leadership effectiveness is judged not by authority or how far up the pyramid people sit, but by how well they work with the resources at their disposal, no matter how limited, and how effectively they help free their own", "Perhaps, he posited, we should think of leaders and managers differently, not as making decisions based on past data, but as creating forms so that people can flourish in the future", "Instead of looking at leadership as decision making—as a rational process of sifting through data, analyzing trends, and making decisions based on predicting futures—a design framework emphasizes pragmatic experimentation. It sees managers as form givers, idea generators, agents who transform imperfect situations into better ones by questioning assumptions, exploring tangential ideas, and creating metaphors that stimulate thinking. Actions are experimental, and knowledge is applied, pragmatic, and ongoing rather than stable, objective, and predictive.", "While a traditional, rational approach to understanding managerial action tends to favor analytic activities such as optimizing, minimizing risk, and selecting among predetermined activities, a design approach takes note of how managers shape worlds of interpretation in which others can make meaningful contributions", "This is a different art of leadership, designing just enough structure that constrains and guides the soloist to discover new possibilities.", "One day, Ellington asked him to play like the trumpeter Buddy Bolden. “I said, ‘Maestro, I don’t know who the hell Buddy Bolden is!’ Duke said, ‘Oh sure, you know Buddy Bolden. Buddy Bolden was suave, handsome, and a debonair cat who the ladies loved. Aw, he was so fantastic! He was fabulous! He was always sought after. He had the biggest, fattest trumpet sound in town. He bent notes to the nth degree. He used to tune up in New Orleans and break glasses in Algiers! . . . As a matter of fact, you are Buddy Bolden!’", "This, too, is provocative competence in action. First, it’s clear that Ellington held an affirmative image of Clark Terry: he saw Terry at his best, appreciated his potential, and held on to that image even though Terry appeared confused and directionless. Notice all of the superlatives he used to describe Buddy Bolden—fabulous; fantastic; always sought after; biggest, fattest sound—and then how Ellington segued effortlessly into letting Terry know that he had been talking about him all along.", "Leadership as design activity means creating space, sufficient support, and challenge so that people will be tempted to grow on their own. The goal is the opposite of conformity: a leader’s job is to create the discrepancy and dissonance that trigger people to move away from habitual positions and repetitive patterns. I’ve come to think of this key leadership capacity as “provocative competence.”", "In jazz, as in business, we need leaders who do this—men and women who support imaginative leaps, who can create a context that enhances creative possibilities and triggers glimpses, sudden insights, bold speculation, imaginative ventures, and a willingness (even an insistence) that people explore new possibilities before there is certainty and before they fully comprehend the meaning of what they are doing. Leadership of this sort demands good design. These leaders have to create space that suggests possibilities, while also providing the right amount of constraints and limitations. They also need a capacity to notice peoples’ potential, perhaps better than they see it themselves. Only then can leaders disrupt routines in a way that demands that people stretch themselves beyond their comfort level. This is what provocative competence is all about—leadership that enlivens activity and rouses the mind to life.", "This is the nature of the competency trap—strengths and capabilities become rigidities that block learning and adaptation", "Jazz musicians face similar temptations every day—to favor exploitation of patterns, to rely on well-learned stock phrases and on licks that have been greeted enthusiastically in past performances, to become in effect imitations of themselves.", "To keep from falling into the competency trap, veteran players actively court what many might regard as risky, even perilous activity. They make deliberate efforts to create disruptions and incremental reorientations, hoping to outwit their learned habits by putting themselves in unfamiliar musical situations", "The search was always for something that sounded right to replace the things that sounded predictable and [therefore] wrong", "You have to choose to be secure like a stone, or insecure but able to flow.”", "I had been a musician all my life, had all this training, played with all these great players, but I knew I could never have created that. And if I can’t do it, something is missing—I have to find out how to do it! I’ve always been like that when I’ve heard something I liked but I couldn’t do. That’s how I got into jazz. I heard this guy playing [jazz piano] at a variety show in high school, and I knew that he knew what he was doing, and he was doing it on my instrument—but I had no idea of what was going on. SO I wanted to learn how to do it. That’s what got me started. In order to do that, you have to know what you don’t know", "Davis would sometimes call tunes in different keys or call tunes that the band had not rehearsed. What’s more, he would do this in concert, before a live audience. “I pay you to do your practicing on the bandstand,” Hancock recalls Davis telling them. Such a high-risk strategy was dangerous enough with a seasoned band, but at the time Hancock is recounting, Davis’s band was made up of mostly young players, in their early twenties. Drummer Tony Williams was in his teens, and the band had almost no experience playing together. Keith Jarrett says that as part of Davis’s commitment to “keeping the music fresh and moving,” he steered away from his own pleasures as well. “Do you know why I don’t play ballads any more?” Jarrett recalled Davis telling him. “Because I like to play ballads so much", "Davis’s quintet had never seen this music before, they were unfamiliar with the odd forms, and they had no rehearsal. The very first time they performed this music, the tape recorder was running. The result was the album Kind of Blue, widely regarded as a landmark jazz event—maybe the landmark event and the best-selling jazz recording in history.", "Kind of Blue consists entirely of “first takes.” When we listen to this album, we are witnessing the musicians approaching these pieces for the first time, simultaneously discovering new music and inventing it. Some have called it the perfect jazz album: melodic, lyrical, grip- ping, swinging, intellectually demanding, and completely spontaneous", "They took a few steps, repeated a prior phrase, ventured out, extended, and moved forward. And the effect is amazing: a group learning in real time as it created a historic piece of art.", "In the next section, we will break down provocative competence into its component parts. For now, notice that Davis did not act on consensus. Much of the leadership literature suggests that leaders seek consensus from the group and get buy-in for their vision. However, like Ellington, Davis didn’t ask for input before initiating these moves. If he had polled the quintet in advance and asked them how they felt about playing for a recording session in strange modes and forms, he would have gotten puzzlement, certainly, but not approval or consensus", "Davis sent out probes and tentative prompts, but they were there mostly to spark conversation, to get activity going, something to play with. Leaders like this know that they don’t create great things alone. They concoct directions to get groups mov- ing, and they don’t expect that all of them will work out. If a better idea emerges as a result, then it’s not a failure, but there’s no way of knowing initially. It’s a state of continuous, reflexive inquiry.", "Provocative competence is, first, an affirmative move. What makes these interventions powerful is that the leader holds a positive image of what others are capable of. This often means seeing other people’s strengths better than they see their own strengths.", "Leaders who exhibit provocative competence are aware that this is a moment of learning vulnerability. Things could go either way. There’s no guarantee that the experience will be successful, and in fact the players in the Kind of Blue session had no idea that they had made musical history until several years later when people began responding to the music and exploring its possibilities. These are moments of dis- quiet when people are momentarily off balance, and too much provo- cation or a provocation that calls attention to weaknesses is potentially fatal if you are trying to trigger discovery, receptivity, and openness. It’s important to create a holding culture, an environment that provides enough stability and reassurance so that people know there is a safety net, someone to watch their backs as they branch out.", "Second, provocative competence involves introducing a small disruption to routine. What makes provocative competence an “art” is the introduction of just enough unusual material that it engages people to be mindful—to pay attention in new ways. The disruption must be scaled appropriately. To that end, timing is critical. Leaders who disrupt on a regular basis or try to be provocative all the time are obnoxious, and are eventually ignored and probably mimicked. Too much disruption in the moment is also something to be mindful of. This is what makes provocative competence an art. In Davis’s case, the disruption was scaled with a master’s hand and a clear nod toward the affirmation just mentioned. Davis didn’t suggest that the drummer play the piano, or the bass player, the sax. Those would have been little more than galling stunts. Rather, he disrupted routine just enough to free his quintet to go where it had never gone before.", "it’s key to create situations that demand activity. But further, it was not an “all or nothing” action. Players are expected to try and try again, to keep trying and dis- covering as they go. Passivity was not an option that day. The musicians couldn’t step back, ponder awhile, and wait for someone else to do something. Once Davis counted off the song and started it, there was no turning back. People needed to leap in and start doing", "The fourth element in this process is facilitating incremental reorientation by encouraging repetition. The repetition constitutes, in effect, a comfort zone, but not one that is too comfortable. Even while people are leaning on old habits, they have to attend to new cues and new options, and start to manage and process information within a new, broader context. These are moments of gradual insight and slowly evaporating safety. As one of my jazz friends said to me, “Not all repetition is the same.” Sometimes you need to repeat a gesture and then start to notice it from a slightly different angle.", "The final element in our deconstruction of provocative competence is analogic sharpening of perspectives and thought processes. This is the point at which people look back at what is emerging and jump into the morass as they make comparisons, links, and connections to a larger, emerging whole. They link the familiar with new utterances, adjusting to the unanticipated in a way that reframes previous material. These are delicate moments in which each interpretation has implications", "for how one might proceed. People start to notice affinity between pieces that previously seemed disconnected; resemblances that no one noticed before start to emerge", "No prior planning would have made these linkages. Rather, under the guidance of provocative competence, people start to make parallel links with seemingly unrelated contexts and see linkages between seemingly disparate ideas", "saying yes to the mess means finding affirmation in the best of what already exists. Every group, every individual has some strength, some moment of exceptional performance that has the potential to make a difference at some point. Truly gifted leaders— those who practice and exhibit provocative competence—are able to uncover this potential even when it is well hidden, even when the individuals in question can’t see it in themselves. That’s a true gift: to be able to see people at their very best when their current behavior is far less than that.", "Socrates once said that wisdom begins with wonder. Is it possible for business leaders to create conditions that nurture wonderment?", "I would argue that it’s not only possible but obligatory. We have to recognize first, though, that this is a different mode of leadership. The literature on charismatic leadership insists on the need to create a clear vision and stay committed to it through thick and thin. Fair enough, but management built around provocative competence does some- thing more. It requires that leaders act with confidence even as they are doubting, questioning, and probing their assumptions", "Provocative leaders develop double vision. They create new narratives while simultaneously understanding that those narratives don’t yet fully exist. They invite people to live in hopeful stories. These invitations are not just exercises of the imagination. They demand that people become deeply involved. Provocative leaders are not good listeners in the traditional sense. They don’t hear just what’s being said. They hear more than what’s being said; they “over-listen,” hear the overtones of what might emerge, and read more than what is on the page.", "they constantly provoke their own understandings by surrounding themselves with people willing to disagree with them, perhaps to the nth degree. To look out over the chaotic and unclear messages in the world and see opportunity, to assume that something of value can be discovered and developed—these are skills to be cherished.", "The event was an off-site workshop called to consider ways to improve customer service for business class. However, instead of having participants sleep in regular hotel rooms, one executive had the beds removed and replaced with airline seats. This no doubt disturbed the taken- for-granted routines, not to mention sleep patterns. But, faced with the puzzle of these unexpected constraints, attendees came up with a number of innovations to improve comfort, including the design of a more comfortable seat that included a footrest. In jazz terms, such an irregular arrangement disturbed “stock phrases” and comfortable play- ing, encouraging members to improvise new solutions", "Then there’s the R&D executive at Sony who wanted to create a mini compact disc player but was faced with engineers who had helped develop the original CD technology and were convinced it could not be made more compact. To break the mental logjam, the executive walked into a meeting with a five-inch block of carved wood and told the engineers that the new CD player could be no bigger.", "Like improving jazz players, we should be constantly sending out experimental probes to see what kind of responses they attract.", "eBay founder Pierre Omidyar did in 1995 when he used his personal Web site to start “Auction Web.” He had no idea what items would sell or what kind of response he would get, but he soon discovered that the idea had remarkable attraction—an attraction that developed into eBay. Omidyar never could have developed eBay by starting with market analysis, studying past patterns (because there weren’t any), predicting trends, and then creating this product and entering the market based on predictions. It took an experimental move, a probe, to see what would attract responses. Like jazz players, Omidyar had to leap in and take action with no guarantee of what the results would be.", "What is singular about each of these examples is that the principals Eiji Toyada, Tony Lo, and Miles Davis (and by extension Duke Ellington)—jumped the evolutionary process. They didn’t wait for a product or an idea to become inevitable or unavoidable. All of them had visions of something better on the horizon. All disrupted routine to enable their team to get there. They affirmed the best in those who worked for them. They raised the bar high and demanded activity— but always to achieve worthwhile goals—and they allowed those they provoked to competence and beyond to proceed incrementally", "In a more global sense, these leaders also chose what parts of the organization to nurture and refine. They created organizational designs, structures, tasks, and a culture that encouraged improvisation in the right locations. Also, they were careful to preserve organizational memory—to maintain those routines that are crucial and retain practices that should not be abandoned. Change isn’t about blow- ing everything up; that’s chaos and headlines. Change that endures is about designing organizational structures to sustain successful exist- ing procedures while simultaneously triggering improvisation and creativity beyond existing capabilities"]
