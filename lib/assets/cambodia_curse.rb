book_notes = ["Cambodia’s leaders fell back into old patterns of self-interested turpitude. As a result, even today, Cambodians remain the most abused people in the world.\\n\\nMarch 30, 2018", "Cambodia is the only nation in the world where it has been demonstrated that symptoms of PTSD and related traumatic illnesses are being passed from one generation to the next.\\n\\nMarch 30, 2018", "“Mental health is the last priority here,” said Michael O’Leary, head of the World Health Organization office in Phnom Penh. “The ability to provide support is really quite limited.”\\n\\nApril 8, 2018", "“One of the great tragedies of Cambodia was that from 1993 on, no new leadership has emerged,” Wiedemann said. “It’s the same players since back in the early 1990s. Most are venal, and most are engaged in a battle among themselves rather than for the good of the country.” As Carol Rodley, deputy chief of mission when Ken Quinn was ambassador, observed, “Cambodia needs a hero.”\\n\\nApril 8, 2018", "“I do not use my role for family or personal benefit. Some individuals use such an opportunity to do that. But I am committed to doing something for the people. My business is another thing.” Then he confided, “I have no education. I went to a temple school for only four years.” But his business card lists a doctorate in business administration—a common dishonest conceit for prominent Cambodians. His voice carried a pleading tone as he said, “I hope you can see that I am a normal person.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "“We must solve the problems of the agriculture sector so it can grow. The well-educated people were killed by the Khmer Rouge. So today’s younger generation, the people who are trained and educated, if we want to grow as a nation we need to send these people back to help the farmers improve their rice.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "But starting in the mid-1990s Cambodia acquired a new industry, a new source of wealth. Several Asian nations, principally China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan, on their own initiative, began building garment factories in Cambodia. They saw the low-wage labor market as particularly attractive. Over the following years the number of these factories rose to more than three hundred. They employed as many as 380,000 Cambodians, primarily women. The workers made jeans, T-shirts, baseball caps, and sweaters, primarily, and sold almost three-quarters of their products to the United States. The factories grew to produce 70 percent of Cambodia’s exports. The only real competition was rice.\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "“The economy has three legs: garments, tourism, and agriculture. Levi Strauss or the Gap could destroy this country on a whim.” When the world economic crisis hit in 2008, Mussomeli’s dark vision came true. Orders from American retailers plummeted. Tens of thousands of Cambodians lost their jobs. But Hun Sen had a ready solution. “Unemployment hasn’t caused a very big crisis for our country,” he insisted, because “those people can go back to the fields and grow more rice.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "We need to expand business, but to establish a company here is so complicated. It discourages entrepreneurship. You lose so much money, so much time. Here it takes at least forty-five days to start a company. In Singapore it takes thirty minutes, and you can do it online. The government needs to shorten registration time, remove barriers for imports.” What’s more, “the transport costs are three times what they are in Vietnam. There are time delays on imports, and you have to pay a lot on the way. Customs, capital control, agriculture ... several parties are involved,” meaning several agencies taking bribes. “If they do not remove these barriers, we cannot move forward.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "The government said it planned to build several hydroelectric dams that would, in theory, provide electricity to the provinces. China was promising to help pay for them. Few put much faith in that promise. For these and so many other problems, In Channy, the bank president, said, “We need a clear vision from the top. In our society, normally small people follow their leader.” In the meantime, Kamlesh Vyas, the Cambodia director of a South Asian NGO who tried to work with farmers in Battambang Province, shook his head as he offered his own analysis. “They are just following the past because that’s all they can do. You can’t impart new skills to people with no education.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "Eighty percent of Cambodian farmers lived as she did, wholly dependent on the weather to survive. That year, 2009, Cambodia suffered a drought, and climate change already seemed to be bringing on drought conditions more and more often.\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "Cambodia has never offered welfare or relief for the poor. The government has never made agricultural subsidies or even low-interest loans available to the public. “This is a totally free market,” Kith Seng said with a rueful smile. “The government relies on the private sector. And whether they build a rice mill will depend on the market. The policy of the government is entirely free market. We leave all of that to the private sector.” What that meant, really, was that the government did nothing.\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "If education is the answer for Cambodian society, as so many experts assert, then the nation is lost. In a nationwide survey only 2.6 percent of Cambodia’s schoolteachers said they were providing students “a high-quality education.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "These fees and payments are all but untraceable. All government salaries and payments were made in cash, and they were not documented. “Everyone in government is paid in cash,” said In Channy, president of Acleda Bank. In fact, “77 percent of the economy works on cash.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "Almost fifty years later, in 2009, Women’s Affairs Minister Ing Kantha Phavi noted, “It’s still the dream of every Cambodian to work in government. They can make a lot of money,” she added with a smile, while offering the slippery-finger gesticulation for corruption. “Very few get hired now, but it is still the dream. These other areas,” engineering, agriculture, technology, “they are not attractive subjects.” What’s more, “a lot of parents don’t like to see their children working in these other areas.”\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "Students remained so focused on becoming mandarins that the state had little choice but to build the National University of Management. It opened in its current form in 2004 and immediately became the most popular college in Cambodia’s university system.\\n\\nApril 15, 2018", "Inside, Kdep Sokhin lectured about long division while writing examples on the chalkboard, smiling at the children as he spoke. He, too, wore a white shirt and jet-black pants, though stripes of yellow dust filled the creases behind his knees. He was twenty-six and had been teaching there for four years. “Teaching’s not really fun,” he said when class was over, that smile still affixed to his face. “The children are easy, but it’s hard to survive on this salary and have money to buy petrol for my motorbike. There are only two teachers here and 143 students in grades 1 to 5.”\\n\\nApril 16, 2018", "Yet “there is no cultural tradition for reconciling contrary opinions—or even for the acceptance of the existence of contrary opinions,” the Swedes wrote in their book, Every Home an Island. As a result, in any debate one side or the other is certain to lose face. “So when Khmer men resort to violence—when young men form gangs, or when a husband beats his wife, almost to death,” they are “impotent human beings who act out of frustration because their ‘cultural heritage’ offers no other way out of a humiliating situation. In most cases an act of violence is preferable to the loss of face.”\\n\\nApril 16, 2018", "Mussomeli said he preferred a low-key approach to all of this. “I think the effective way to deal with the corruption problem is not to pontificate. It is to talk about destiny rather than morality. ‘You are so far behind your neighbors, Vietnam and Thailand. You will become a vassal state if you don’t take this last chance to compete. You cannot afford the luxury of corruption.’ That’s what I tell them. You know,” he added, “when you say critical things, they are genuinely afraid the West is trying to undermine or subvert the government. In fact, we should be able to offer criticism as a concerned friend.” But he quickly learned that being a “concerned friend” of the Cambodian government was difficult work.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "But the truth was, for all the foment over the Global Witnesses report, by the time it was published, in June 2007, most of Cambodia’s luxury-wood trees had already been felled. Illegal logging, deforestation, was a dying business. Hun Sen and his oknya had already moved on to a new line of work: seizing and selling off Cambodia’s land—even if Cambodians lived on it.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "“Older traumas, they are going to influence current responses to things like land seizures,” said Nigel Field, the psychologist who studied PTSD among Cambodians. After all, that scene Quinn had witnessed with his fiancée, atop the Vietnamese hill on the Cambodian border in 1973, was eerily similar. Khmer Rouge soldiers had thrown residents out of their homes, then burned them to the ground and trucked the people off to a relocation camp.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "“Out here, I cannot make business,” Un Phea complained two years later, with considerable understatement. “They dumped us here and gave us no money, no land title. Nothing.” She sat in the mud outside her shanty house—one small room with palm-frond walls and roof, on poles three feet off the ground. One of her naked children sat underneath, eating a small bowl of rice. Un Phea was peeling bamboo shoots into a plastic bowl—still seething. “Before, I sold water and some eggs in front of the royal palace and made a good living. Here it is hard to work.”\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "In the late 2000s Phnom Penh was booming, and when a developer spotted a choice piece of land, he simply paid off the proper official to win a newly minted land title. “What happens is they bribe the judge, and then they have the title,” said Javier Merelo de Barbera Llobet, who served as an aid worker in Battambang. “Then they can prove the land is theirs.”\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "And as property values rose—in 2007 land in downtown Phnom Penh cost about the same as land in downtown Chicago—the land seizures escalated into an epidemic.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "all those other terrible stories of evictions, “you have to think this is a case of propaganda,” he insisted. “There are different kinds of people who use these issues for their own political interests. We can say we are not doing perfect. But if you don’t like what we are, don’t vote for us. If the government does bad things, the people will rise up. Sometimes we protect the people. Sometimes we protect the interests of investors.” After all, he added, eyes wide, “some millionaires are behind some of these projects!” Thank goodness Hun Sen has his national spokesman on the job to protect evictees.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "he acknowledged that, perhaps, a Christian church may not have been the answer for these people. “The biggest need here is food. Food is very important. Some people don’t have enough, so they borrow from neighbors. Some of them are deeply in debt.” The preacher added: “They are still angry. They need help. They need electricity, they need water. They bought power from a local man who had a generator. But he charged very high prices. But the generator has been broken for two months.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "Cambodia’s international development partners are strongly committed to Cambodian development and are anxious to be a part of the solution. But they may also be part of the problem. The failure to speak out for Cambodia’s poor with one voice or to link financial and technical support to performance and outcomes has sent mixed signals to the country’s leadership, which has shown itself adept at doing just enough to win donor support.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "The very heart of any effective anticorruption law, anywhere in the world, must be the public declaration of assets. For years and years donors and diplomats in Cambodia had made that point so many times that it grew to be a mantra. Only when an official’s holdings are held up to public scrutiny can anyone see whether his financial dealings are aboveboard. The new Cambodian law stipulated that asset declarations would remain secret. The only people who could see the corrupt officials’ accounts were other corrupt officials—if the declarations were made at all.\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "the law forbade gifts, or “commissions” (i.e., bribes), to government officials in exchange for favors, such as forest or land titles. But that provision had an exception. These gifts were permissible when they were “in accordance with custom and tradition.” Well, paying bribes for government positions, or for economic opportunities, had been “custom and tradition” for 1,000 years. Finally, the law gave the government authority to file defamation or disinformation suits against anyone who filed a complaint that “leads to useless inquiry.”\\n\\nApril 20, 2018", "The assistant minister took enough to buy new tires for his car. His deputy simply stuffed some cash in his pocket. After all, government commerce was carried out entirely in cash.\\n\\nApril 20, 201"]
