ADOLPHUS GREEN, founder, Nabisco\\n\\nSeptember 5, 2017", "Everyone in the room knew about leveraged buyouts, often called LBOs. In an LBO, a small group of senior executives, usually working with a Wall Street partner, proposes to buy its company from public shareholders, using massive amounts of borrowed money. Critics of this procedure called it stealing the company from its owners and fretted that the growing mountain of corporate debt was hindering America’s ability to compete abroad. Everyone knew LBOs meant deep cuts in research and every other imaginable budget, all sacrificed to pay off debt. Proponents insisted that companies forced to meet steep debt payments grew lean and mean. On one thing they all agreed: The executives who launched LBOs got filthy rich.\\n\\nSeptember 9, 2017", "That’s my point, Vernon,” Johnson said. “This company should be in play. It should be sold to the highest bidder. If somebody wants to offer eighty-five dollars [a share] or more than we can pay, then we’ve all done an even better job for our shareholders. The management of this company is not dedicated to retaining its jobs at the expense of the shareholders.”\\n\\nSeptember 9, 2017", "“He who’s not busy being born is busy dying.” Tony Peskett, who imbued Johnson with a lifelong belief in the creative uses of chaos, put it another way: “The minute you establish an organization, it starts to decay.” Johnson, who carried that idea to every business he ever ran, boiled it down into a personal philosophy called “shit stirring”: a love for constant restructuring and reorganizing.\\n\\nSeptember 9, 2017", "Most chief executives wouldn’t have bothered; many companies live with low stock prices all their lives, and almost no chief executive thinks Wall Street gives his stock its due.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "Portfolio managers liked Philip Morris’s predictability. They thought they knew where Maxwell was going. They never knew what Johnson was up to.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "His first deal, in 1965, was the $9.5 million acquisition of a Mount Vernon, New York, dental products maker named Stern Metals. It remained his blueprint for years. Kohlberg formed a shell company, backed by a group of investors he assembled, to buy Stern from its seventy-two-year-old family patriarch, using mostly borrowed money. The Sterns retained a stake in the business and continued to run it. Eight months later Kohlberg sold some of his stock—which he had bought for $1.25 a share—to the public for $8 a share, using the proceeds to retire debt. Kohlberg then took the company on a buying spree, snapping up a California dental supply company, an Ohio X-ray firm, and a European maker of dental chairs. When the original investors sold off their $500,000 investment in the transformed company to the public two years later, it was worth $4 million.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "As the vast conglomerates of the 1960s shed businesses in the face of a declining stock market in the early 1970s, Kohlberg branched out to buy their cast-off divisions. He liked basic industry, companies that made things like bricks and wires and valves, whose management, products, and earnings were solid and reliable. Because he borrowed heavily to buy companies, getting a fix on future earnings and cash flows was crucial if Kohlberg was to avoid having his loans called. Balance sheets were his tarot cards, cash flow projections his crystal ball. Once Kohlberg got his hands on a company, he ruthlessly cut costs and sold unwanted businesses, freeing up every extra dollar to pay debts. In most cases he gave management stock incentives, which he found did wonders for their ability to run the business more efficiently. When he was done, the leaner, meaner result was usually worth more than when he bought it. In their most basic guise, LBOs have worked the same way ever since.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "Decisions on the trading floor are made in a split second, profits on fractions of a point. Kohlberg’s buyout business, in contrast, was based on returns that took three, four, five years to realize, an eternity to Bear’s dominant trading culture. “Overnight was long-term for Bear Stearns,” Kravis liked to say. Cy Lewis thought Kohlberg was spending far too much on his silly buyout sideline. It simply took too long to make a buck, when it made a buck at all.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "After a company was acquired, Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts kept a close watch on its budgets, but otherwise gave its management more or less free rein to streamline and meet its mountainous debts. In most cases it worked like a charm. When it didn’t, as in the firm’s second buyout, an oil field services firm named L. B. Foster that ran into the teeth of an industry slump, heads rolled, and new management was swiftly brought in. After five to eight years they resold their companies, or took them public again, often getting three, four, five, even ten times their original investment. By 1983 Kohlberg Kravis claimed an average annual return of 62.7 percent to their investors. Their own 20 percent stake made the three men rich.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "took private a Cincinnati company, Gibson Greetings, for $80 million, using only a million dollars of its own money. When Simon took Gibson public eighteen months later, it sold for $290 million. Simon’s $330,000 investment was suddenly worth $66 million in cash and securities.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "The Internal Revenue Code, by making interest but not dividends deductible from taxable income, in effect subsidized the trend. That got LBOs off the ground. What made them soar was junk bonds.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "Thanks to junk bonds, LBO buyers, once thought too slow to compete in a takeover battle, were able to mount split-second tender offers of their own for the first time. Suddenly LBOs became a viable alternative in every takeover situation; because they held out the promise of operating autonomy and vast riches, Kohlberg Kravis and other firms were swamped with requests from chief executives to become “white knight” rescuers of their raider-besieged companies. It was a symbiotic relationship repeated in deal after deal: raider seeks target; target seeks LBO; and\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "raider, target, and LBO firm all profit from the outcome. The only ones hurt were the company’s bondholders, whose holdings were devalued in the face of new debt, and employees, who often lost their jobs. In the sheer joy of making money, Wall Street didn’t pay too much attention to either group.\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2017", "“Ten Steps to a Successful LBO”: WEEKS ONE THROUGH THREE: Preliminary work on values and price discussions. WEEK FOUR: Meet with banks to discuss loans. WEEK FIVE: Banks work to refine a loan structure. WEEK SIX: Management decides whether to pursue LBO. WEEK SEVEN: Directors are quietly informed and asked to secretly form an “independent” committee to analyze any LBO proposal. WEEK EIGHT: Management prepares a merger agreement. WEEK NINE: Management makes an initial proposal to the board. Negotiations begin with the independent committee. A press release is issued stating the board is “considering a buyout proposal.” WEEK TEN: An acquisition agreement is executed and announced publicly. The idea is to keep the entire process secret until a deal has been cut, ending the bidding before it can begin. Placing a gun to the board’s head, in Wall Street parlance, is intended to leave directors with few options. Disclosing the overture prematurely tends to put the company “in play” for corporate raiders and risks frightening off a certain offer from management. For years boards capitulated and signed merger agreements with the “ambushing” management. Many still did. Wall Street strategists such as Hill consider it crucial to sneak up on a board with a fully financed offer ready to be launched. He naturally assumed Johnson felt the same way.\\n\\nSeptember 16, 2017", "Go for it, Buffett advised. Once one of RJR’s largest shareholders, he knew tobacco and liked it.\\n\\nSeptember 17, 2017", "“I’ll tell you why I like the cigarette business,” he said. “It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. It’s addictive. And there’s fantastic brand loyalty.”\\n\\nSeptember 17, 2017"]
