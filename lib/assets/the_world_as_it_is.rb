This was the gift and the struggle of working for Obama.\\n\\nSeptember 22, 2018", "Obama was unique in that the mere fact of his own identity was going to leave an imprint on people abroad. In addition to being the American president, he was a symbol for the aspirations of billions of people—particularly ethnic minorities in the developed world and young people in the developing world. It’s why we carved out time for him to engage populations who wouldn’t normally meet an American president—playing soccer in a favela in Brazil, meeting Dalits in India, or visiting a refugee center in Malaysia. It’s why we established programs for him to engage young people, particularly in the two regions most associated with his background, Africa and Southeast Asia. And it’s one reason why he focused so much on the words that he spoke abroad. “We’re telling a story,” he told me early that first year, “about who we are.”\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2018", "“Why don’t I just give this to you—you can fill in the others.” With that, he proceeded to pace slowly around the Oval Office for nearly an hour, pausing every so often over the pad on his desk, dictating his outline. Within it he had embedded a series of policy decisions and how he wanted them framed—about how to categorize detainees at Gitmo, about how to balance transparency and secrecy in government. When he was finished, he told me to scrub it with the rest of the staff and get him a draft in a few days. And so I had the awkward responsibility—as, essentially, a midlevel staffer—of calling a meeting the following day with the senior White House staff so that I could tell them what the president wanted to do. As I was working on this speech, it became clear to me how agencies form their own antibodies against a president’s desire to move in a particular direction.\\n\\nSeptember 22, 2018", "As one Muslim colleague said to me, the phrase “radical Islam” is heard by many Muslims as a characterization of Islam itself and not of a faction within it. Meanwhile, the polling that had been done showed that what most Muslims actually cared about was poverty, corruption, and unemployment. If you asked them what they wanted to work with America on, the answers were education and entrepreneurship, science and technology. If you asked them what U.S. policy was focused on, they said oil, Israel, and weakening the Muslim world.\\n\\nSeptember 22, 2018", "Years later, after Obama left office, I ran into a Palestinian-born woman whom I knew casually. She said she’d never forgotten the Cairo speech, which she connected to the initial protests of the Arab Spring. I said that that was assigning too much responsibility to a speech. “It wasn’t the speech,” she said. “It was him. The young people saw him, a black man as president of America, someone who looked like them. And they thought, why not me?”\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2018", "As would often be the case, he vented about things that he could not really change, the structural dynamic in Washington that sees politics as a game and foreign policy as an extension of politics.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2018", "He sat next to me on the couch and began to talk, not so much about the speech, but about the kind of president he wanted to be. “The American people are idealists,” he said, “but their leaders have to be realistic and hard-headed.” At the beginning and end of the speech, he wanted to draw upon American idealism—Roosevelt’s belief that we “carry special burdens” in the world. In between, he wanted to acknowledge that in disorderly places there is a limit to what we can achieve.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2018", "Another time, at a meeting on what he was aiming to accomplish in his first term, I pointed to the potential for a democratic opening in Burma. “Ben,” he said, “no one cares about Burma in Ohio.” These comments stuck with me. For the first time, I felt out of step with my boss. In the quiet of my empty apartment, I began to wrestle with bigger questions. How would I see myself in five years if I couldn’t remember what I was like five years ago? How do you establish your own voice when your entire reputation is founded on someone else’s? How much can you compromise your own positions in service of a larger good before you sacrifice them? I felt we had gradually trimmed our sails and lowered our sights\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2018", "I looked, increasingly, for smaller things that I could work on—if I had outlets on issues where I could make a difference, it could add a layer to my experience at work separate from the grind of politics and the intractability of some of the larger issues on our agenda.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2018", "Obama would practice an answer, and then we’d critique his performance. “Get into it faster.” “Look at the person who asked the question.” “Don’t forget your home base.” At some point, Obama, who liked to name the absurdities of politics, snapped. “I get it,” he said. “So this isn’t really a debate at all, it’s just a performance.” He asked that we just write up the best answers he could give on key questions, drawing on the best answers he gave in debate prep.\\n\\nSeptember 25, 2018", "Afterward, as the flight to Cambodia gained altitude, Obama came to see me. “That was worth doing,” he said. He looked out the window. “It’s interesting how the place feels frozen in time. It reminds me of what Jakarta looked like when I lived there. Now it’s just high-rises. They’d be smart to preserve some of what makes this part of the world different.”\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2018", "I also argued that if we were going to intervene in Syria’s civil war, we should do so with our own military. From Central America to Afghanistan, America didn’t have a great track record with arming proxies. If we thought it was worth tipping the balance against Assad, we should be debating whether to strike his regime directly. I pressed this point in a few meetings in late 2012 and early 2013, but I was usually the only person doing so other than Jake and Samantha. In one meeting early in the second term, Obama went around the room as he normally did when he wanted to test the status quo of his policies. Jake and I were sitting together on the back bench, and when it got to us, we made versions of the same argument. If things keep deteriorating, I said, we should “consider bombing Assad’s runways” or we should “consider limited strikes against some regime infrastructure.”\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2018", "SOUTHEAST ASIA BECAME THE other region I took on, as it pulled together the different threads of what interested me the most in our foreign policy: the burden of history, and the wars in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; the strategic importance of a region that was increasingly important to our position vis-à-vis China; an essential part of any effort to combat climate change; a sprawling place populated by people of different religions and ethnicities. A place of opportunity.\\n\\nSeptember 25, 2018", "“We know that, like South Africa, the United States had to overcome centuries of racial subjugation. As was true here, it took sacrifice—the sacrifice of countless people, known and unknown, to see the dawn of a new day. Michelle and I are beneficiaries of that struggle….Over 30 years ago, while still a student, I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles taking place in this beautiful land, and it stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities to others and to myself, and it set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be a better man.”\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2018", "Technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2018", "“We went in, ordered some food, took pictures with the staff, and then she left,” he said. “I ended up shaking every hand in there. Most of the folks in these places have been watching Fox News and think I’m the Antichrist. But if you show up, shake their hand, and look them in the eye, it’s harder for them to turn you into a caricature. You might even pick up a few votes.”\\n\\nSeptember 30, 2018", "He talked about what it took to win the presidency. To win, he told us, you have to have a core reason why you’re running, and you need to make it clear to everyone how much you want to win. “You have to want it,” he said, like Michael Jordan demanding the ball in the final moments of a game.\\n\\nSeptember 30, 201"]
