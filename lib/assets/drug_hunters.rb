Even worse, there were vast differences between the ether offered by different suppliers, with the most incompetently concocted versions failing at their most important task—putting patients to sleep. This lack of consistency made it very difficult to know how much ether to administer to ensure patients stayed unconscious without actually halting their respiration and killing them. Surgeons needed a standardized formulation of ether they could trust. The demand for standardized products was felt across many industries at the dawn of the Industrial Age in the mid-nineteenth century. Before the invention of electricity, the entire nation was illuminated by kerosene lamps. The largest and most successful corporation in the history of the world, Standard Oil, attained success because it was the very first company to standardize its preparation of kerosene—hence the company’s name. If you bought a gallon of Standard Oil’s kerosene in California, it was exactly the same as a gallon of Standard Oil’s kerosene purchased in New York. Rockefeller used standardization to outcompete hundreds of other local kerosene manufacturers and eventually establish a monopoly of the entire energy market, all because he offered a reliable, consistent product that customers could count on.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "The company’s reputation for producing trustworthy, standardized medicines led to high national demand for Squibb products. This consistency is embodied in Squibb’s original logo, used all the way into the 1980s when the company was acquired by Bristol-Myers. The logo comprised a marble pediment emblazoned with the word “reliability,” supported by three columns with the words “uniformity,” “purity,” and “efficacy.”\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "And yet, though it revolutionized surgery, ether would not have revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry if it had been easy to make. Since ether required expansive and expensive technologies to produce a standardized compound, it led drug-making out of the apothecary shop and into the factory.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "The Age of Industrial Formulation was not about inventing new drugs—it was about finding new formulations for existing drugs that could leverage the rapidly growing young science of chemistry and the new manufacturing techniques of industrial factories to produce standardized drugs on a massive scale.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "“The product has no value.” —Heinrich Dreser, director of Bayer Pharmaceutical Research, on aspirin, 1897\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "For centuries, all drug hunters—including physician-botanists, physician-alchemists, and industrial formulators—took it as a given that drugs could only be discovered, like a vein of gold or a hot spring, rather than crafted through human ingenuity, like a steam engine or a typewriter. The notion that it might be possible to engineer a drug to fight a particular malady required an enormous shift in perspective, and the first step in this shift was propelled by the newfound power and precision of synthetic chemistry. Up until this point, all the industrial pharmaceutical companies (such as Squibb) were focused on using chemistry to manufacture known drugs more efficiently and consistently. But Duisberg didn’t just want to improve the manufacture of existing drugs—he wanted to create drugs that had never existed before.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Back to Dreser, head of pharmacological research at Bayer. With regard to diacetylmorphine and acetylsalicylic acid, he felt he needed to keep fishing with one of them and cut bait with the other. Dreser was more concerned about spending resources on acetylsalicylic acid because of salicylic acid’s reputation for weakening the heart, which he feared would remain a side effect in the tweaked version. He judged that the morphine tweak was the more promising candidate and redirected all of his efforts into the development of diacetylmorphine, which Dreser renamed “Heroin.”\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Eichengrün (Bayer’s head chemist) arrived at the opposite judgment. He felt that if there were only resources to pursue a single compound they should keep fishing with acetylsalicylic acid, since there would be almost unlimited applications for an effective remedy that reduced fever and relieved pain. He did not have any hard evidence showing that the salicylic acid tweak would not produce side effects, however. In order to demonstrate that acetylsalicylic acid was safe and effective, he needed data from human trials—and Dreser was blocking any further clinical trials on the drug.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Eichengrün approached a friend and colleague named Felix Goldmann, Bayer’s representative in Berlin, and quietly arranged for low-profile human trials of acetylsalicylic acid in Germany’s capital.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Eichengrün shared his surreptitiously obtained findings with Dreser. Dreser was unimpressed. After reading Eichengrün’s clinical reports on acetylsalicylic acid, Dreser wrote, “This is the usual loud-mouthing of Berlin—the product has no value.” He firmly believed that Heroin represented the future of the company. Duisberg finally intervened in the dispute between his two top lieutenants. He reviewed Eichengrün’s Berlin data, overturned Dreser, and authorized the full clinical testing of acetylsalicylic acid on humans—alongside the full clinical testing of Heroin.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Today, more than 70 million pounds of aspirin are sold each year, about the weight of a small aircraft carrier. The use of the drug has slowly decreased over time because of competition from several other over-the-counter analgesics, especially Tylenol, Advil, and Motrin. Aspirin remains unique among its competitors, however, because it also thins the blood by reducing the aggregation of platelets, so it still maintains enviable sales as a heart medication.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Then, even after Aspirin was launched, it turned out the drug was not actually a new invention at all, since Aspirin had already been synthesized by several other chemists. Despite a gush of generic competitors, Bayer still managed to squeeze blockbuster profits from its synthetic compound through savvy marketing—and then laundered the story of the drug’s discovery to conform with the anti-Semitic politics of early twentieth-century Germany.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "His team synthesized more than nine hundred arsenic-loaded dyes and tested them on rabbits infected with syphilis. Each compound was a failure.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "noticed that one of the compounds seemed to be killing the bacterium without killing its hosts. The compound was labeled “606” because it was the sixth compound in the sixth test group. When Ehrlich reported on the success of 606 in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1911, he named it “arsphenamine.” Clinical studies soon demonstrated that arsphenamine was an effective and safe treatment for syphilis in humans. It was, at last, a bona fide magic bullet. Ehrlich teamed up with the German company Hoechst AG—a company that had provided him with many dyes over the years—to manufacture arsphenamine for commercial use. It was marketed to the public in 1910 under the trade name Salvarsan with the tagline, “The arsenic that saves.” Ehrlich’s toxic warhead was the first reliable and effective treatment for a contagious disease. Put simply, it was the world’s very first cure\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Isak Dinesen, the author of the memoir Out of Africa, was one of the first people to be treated with Salvarsan. A Danish aristocrat whose real name was Baroness Karen von Blixen-Finecke, Dinesen managed a coffee plantation in Kenya for most of her adult life. According to her memoir, her husband was a serial philanderer who infected her with syphilis. After realizing she had contracted the embarrassing and deadly disease, Dinesen returned to Denmark for many long months of treatment with Salvarsan. Although her physicians eventually declared that she was cured, she remained dubious, probably due in part to the fact that no disease—including syphilis—had ever been curable before. Though extensive tests failed to reveal any evidence of syphilis remaining in her system, for the rest of her life she remained convinced that she was still afflicted. Even so, her exquisite writing suggests that she suffered neither from the mental degeneration characteristic of advanced syphilis nor from cerebral damage due to excessive Salvarsan treatments. Ehrlich’s magic bullet enabled Dinesen to become one of the finer literary voices of the twentieth century.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "The enormous success of his drug made Ehrlich a public hero. Whenever he was congratulated for his achievement, however, he modestly replied: “For seven years of misfortune I had one moment of good luck.” If he had correctly understood that the syphilis pathogen and the Trypanosoma pathogen were vastly different microorganisms, he probably would have never tried his toxic warhead on the Italian disease. The German-born Ehrlich concluded from his experience that a drug hunter needed what he called “the four G’s”: Geld (money), Geduld (patience), Geschick (ingenuity), and perhaps most importantly, Glück (luck). His formula was extremely prescient, since money, patience, ingenuity, and a heaping dose of serendipity remain essential ingredients for drug discovery to this very day\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "If too little was administered, the syphilis bacterium would not die. If too much was administered, the patient could die. And the drug was not effective at all if the syphilis had already progressed to an advanced state. But the drug’s chief limitation was the fact that it worked only on a single disease—syphilis. Today, we enjoy the benefits of many “broad-spectrum antibiotics” such as penicillins and fluoroquinolones, drugs that fight a wide range of infectious pathogens. But Salvarsan was a “narrow-spectrum antibiotic”—a one-hit wonder. At the time of Ehrlich’s great discovery, there was not yet a clear notion that it might be possible to develop drugs that attacked multiple types of infections.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "The massive outcry over the Elixir Sulfanilamide poisonings, including well-publicized letters to President Roosevelt from relatives of the victims, prompted Congress to pass the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1938 to regulate the sale and marketing of pharmaceuticals. This act established the modern FDA. These days, the Food and Drug Administration oversees the development of drugs from the very beginning, well in advance of any human testing. All pharmacological research that may eventually lead to the development of a commercial drug must be conducted under a system of management controls called “good laboratory practice” or GLP. An executive at the Big Pharma company Cyanamid once told me that GLP was a system “designed to force you to prove that you are not a crook.”\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "Unlike the development of Elixir Sulfanilamide, there was tight, cautious oversight at every stage of the development of each of the two weight-loss drugs. While AHP had never explicitly tested the fen-phen combination, it was neither unusual nor illegal for physicians to prescribe legitimate drugs in new combinations\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "February 4, 2022", "it is difficult to point the finger at any one person—one greedy villain or one clueless executive—whose poor judgment renders him or her ethically responsible for the drug cocktail–induced injuries. The mitral valve problems were a very rare response that simply did not show up until extremely large numbers of people began extensively using the two drugs in combination. To my mind, where AHP appears to have crossed the line was in their marketing. While it was entirely legitimate for its salespeople to remind doctors about the University of Rochester study, it was both unethical and illegal for the salespeople to explicitly recommend that doctors prescribe the two drugs together unless the FDA had actually approved the use of the fen-phen drug combination.\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "“Superior doctors prevent the disease from happening, mediocre doctors treat the disease before fully evident, inferior doctors treat the disease after it is apparent to everyone.” —Huang Dee Nai-Ching, 2600 B\\n\\nFebruary 4, 2022", "The Pill did not originate in a Big Pharma science lab or a sales team meeting. First, Swiss dairy farmers who wanted to make their cows pregnant faster made a peculiar anatomical discovery. Then, a veterinary professor published this finding, leading to the identification of progesterone as an anti-ovulation drug. An eccentric and solitary chemist figured out how to make progesterone simply because it was an interesting puzzle. Two septuagenarian feminists selected a discredited biologist to realize their dream of creating an oral contraceptive. A devout and hopelessly idealistic Catholic gynecologist agreed to run the world’s first human trials of the oral contraceptive. Together, the biologist and gynecologist dodged federal and state laws—and medical ethics—by holding trials in Puerto Rico and ignoring clear signs of adverse side effects. They only succeeded in convincing a pharmaceutical company terrified of Catholic boycotts to manufacture the drug after the company fortuitously noticed that women were spontaneously using one of their other drugs for the off-label purpose of contraception. This, in a nutshell, is why it is so hard to develop new medicines. Imagine you want to replicate this process: “Can we develop a cure for baldness the same way we developed a birth control pill?” To become a successful drug hunter requires talent, moxie, persistence, luck—and even then, it might not be enough. And we should not overlook Big Pharma’s frustrating and unhelpful role in this process. Every single pharma company rejected Pincus and Sanger’s proposals when they solicited the companies for help developing the Pill. A previously hostile pharma company jumped in only after an independent team of drug hunters sweated and bled their way to an FDA-approvable clinical trial entirely on their own. The modern drug development process is drastically unfair and completely unreasonable, and yet it still managed to significantly improve the lives of hundreds of millions of women. And this is the true nature of drug hunting.\\n\\nFebruary 6, 2022", "sometimes even the most ignorant of beliefs can serve as the catalyst for a crucial discovery. Simply having the motivation to proceed—any motivation—can stir a drug hunter to continue down the rugged path of exploration.\\n\\nFebruary 6, 2022", "We now know that scurvy is a disease caused by a dietary deficiency of vitamin C, a compound required for the synthesis of collagen. Collagen provides the strength, structure, and resiliency for our connective tissues, including our blood vessels, and without enough collagen our connective tissue breaks down and produces the symptoms of scurvy, including bleeding and the reopening of old wounds. Citrus fruits contain high levels of vitamin C, while apple cider contains small amounts of vitamin C; none of the other treatments that Lind employed contain any vitamin C. Since fruits and vegetables could not be stored on long sea voyages, eighteenth-century sailors subsisted on cured meats and dried grains—a diet that lacked vitamin C.\\n\\nFebruary 6, 2022", "There’s an old adage, “It’s better to be lucky than smart.” A drug hunter has the best chance of success when they are both lucky and smart—and Laborit and Kuhn were both.\\n\\nFebruary 6, 2022", "This leads us to our concluding question: is the process of creating a new medicine more like designing the Volt or more like designing The Lone Ranger? Put another way, is drug discovery more like scientific engineering or artistic creativity? More than a century and a half after the establishment of a scientific pharmaceutical industry, the answer is clear. The development of new medicines—including antibiotics, beta blockers, psychoactives, statins, antifungals, and anti-inflammatories—is far more like trying to craft the next Avengers than developing a new car … or a new cell phone, vacuum cleaner, or satellite.\\n\\nFebruary 6, 2022", "There’s another similarity between filmmaking and drug hunting. Hollywood professionals take big risks. If your movie turns into a hit, you will be rich, famous, and potentially shape culture. If your movie flops, on the other hand, you may be broke, notorious, and depressed, potentially hurting your chances of securing support for your next cinematic effort. If you want to try to make it in Hollywood, you need to be brave, vehemently optimistic, and endowed with a short memory so you can forget all the flops you were part of. Of course, some might say you need to be crazy or foolish to work in Hollywood. Most drug hunters I’ve met are brave and optimistic, though a few do qualify as crazy and foolish.\\n\\nFebruary 6, 2022", "The thing about trial and error is that if you keep on trying and keep on being willing to make errors, eventually you will find something that works.\\n\\nFebruary 6, 202"]
