book_notes = ["In cafés there is space where performances of personal and social modernities—in the forms of choice and expression—may be seen. There the lines between “individual” and “community” are drawn lightly, and the freedom to be anonymous can be indulged. The café provides a site for ordinary as well as extraordinary interactions, as it has since its arrival in Japan in the late nineteenth century.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "From the beginning, the Japanese café was more than a cup of coffee and a coffee maker. It has always been something more than the drink on offer.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "The café is itself fluid and protean and can become what people want and need it to be. It is paradoxically both a space for the performance of cultural givens—service, for example, is as significant, though perhaps not as meticulous, as service in a traditional inn—and it is a place for respite from the demands of cultural performances. It is a place where such givens might be ignored—or contested. It is also the place where, for the price of a cup of coffee, anyone can go.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "Providing what one café historian in Japan calls “dry inebriation,” it was also seen as the drink of thoughtfulness, of solace, and it became associated more than any other drink with being “private in public.” Unlike alcoholic drinks in Japan, coffee can accompany a pleasurable solitude.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "The first coffeehouse chain in the world, the Paulista group, was created in Tokyo and Osaka in 1907, appealing to young West-leaning customers, with its Brazilian decor and French-style service. Today, however, the Japanese coffee-lover prefers local independent shops to the chain stores, whether Seattle-based or local. As one habitué of independent cafés said, “There is no character in a Tully's café.” The Japanese café frequenter overseas misses his coffeehouse when he sits in the disorienting anonymity of a chain shop in Chicago or Rome and wonders where he is.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "One man in his late twenties said that as a student he had one café for study and another for dating; now he has fifteen or twenty—for various things, including several, he says, for the taste of their coffee, which had not interested him when he was younger.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "As urban and social changes have broken through the polite fiction of Japan as a homogeneous, harmonious, and consensus-driven society, the importance of the café in allowing or filling gaps—social, temporal, institutional, and personal—increases. The elderly, now forming just under one-quarter of the population, enjoyed coffee as a small indulgence when they were young in postwar reconstruction and now reside in cafés where their coevals congregate. The furiitaa, part-time, freelance young workers, rely on cafés as workspaces and offices very different from those of their salaryman fathers. The unemployed can spend hours there, sometimes filling out job applications and sometimes simply sitting.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "Tei Ei-kei, according to his friend Terashita Tatsuo, decided to “do something for the younger generation by opening a coffeehouse, which would be a space to share knowledge, a social salon where ordinary people, students, and youths could gather…not like the Rokumeikan where Western things are only superficial.”11 He wanted more than a waltz as evidence of cultural integration. His vision came from empathy with the indulged customer rather than from the strategies of a canny businessman; the practicalities of management eluded him. He saw himself in the seats of his café, and dreamed of an attractive superfluity of amenities\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "The hindsight ironies of a Chinese gentleman establishing the first popular coffeehouse in Japan, drawn from a model learned in London, failing from its success, and then ending his days in the future corporate capital of specialty coffee in America, are many. That he learned coffee in America, its spaces in tea-drinking England, and helped to make it the most popular social beverage in tea-identified Japan is only one of these. On the Tokyo monument where the Kahiichakan once stood is a portrait of a pleasant, mustachioed but weak-featured young man, whose dream, in spite of his personal failures, became a success. He saw what modern people needed and gave it to them, but without having the skills of modern business himself, he could not sustain it.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "At home such men might be tended by their families and be isolated from them as their identity as worker outside the house often took precedence over their identity as father or household head. As for the British factory worker or the French bureaucrat, for the Japanese worker, home might be refuge but the café (or pub) was restoration.\\n\\nOctober 9, 2017", "The world of the café in Japan has thus included both continuity and novelty in its attractions. The constant factor is the coffee-designated space for respite, stimulation, or possibly interactions different from those of ordinary life; the novelty lies in the trends and functions the café has responded to, amplified, or introduced. In postwar Japan, for example, “democratization”—or the discussion of what that could possibly mean—found a stage in the cafés near Nagatacho in Tokyo\\n\\nOctober 9, 201"]
