book_notes = ["Any responsible drug maker had to try to minimize risk. But by late 2005, Mylan’s CEO, Robert Coury, was confronting the ultimate wild card: Mylan was losing market share to Indian drug companies that made their own active ingredients in-house and operated at rock-bottom costs. By contrast, Mylan was ordering ingredients from Chinese and Indian suppliers. Mylan couldn’t beat their price—unless it joined them and went global. Coury turned to one of Mylan’s ingredient suppliers, Matrix Laboratories. In December 2005, he met Matrix’s chairman in a New Jersey airport lounge, and the two men hammered out a deal on a cocktail napkin. Mylan would become the first U.S. company to buy a publicly traded Indian company. The deal, which closed in January 2007, gave Mylan a global platform. But perhaps Mylan’s greatest asset from the acquisition was Rajiv Malik himself, who became Mylan’s executive vice president in charge of global technical operations. He brought a number of his tried-and-true team members who’d been with him at Ranbaxy.\\n\\nMay 29, 2020", "Patients tend to assume that their generic drugs are identical to brand-name drugs, in part because they imagine a simple and amicable process: as a patent expires, the brand-name company turns over its recipe, and a generic company makes the same drug, but at a fraction of the cost, since it no longer has to invest in research or marketing. But in fact, generic drug companies fight a legal, scientific, and regulatory battle, often in the dark, from the moment they set out to develop a generic. Mostly, their drugs come to market not with help from brand-name drug companies, but in spite of their efforts to stop them. Brand companies often resort to “shenanigans” and “gaming tactics” to delay generic competition, as the exasperated FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb put it. They will erect a fortress of patents around their drugs, sometimes patenting each manufacturing step—even the time-release mechanism, if there is one. They may make small alterations to their drugs and declare them new, to add years to their patents, a move known as “evergreening.” Rather than sell samples of their drugs, which generic makers need in order to study and reverse-engineer them, brand-name companies will withhold samples, which in 2018 led the FDA to begin publicly shaming the companies accused of such practices\\n\\nMay 29, 2020", "To successfully launch a product, generic drug companies must tread in reverse through this obstacle course. Once a generic company zeroes in on a molecule, and its scientists figure out how it operates in the body, its lawyers get to work to establish how well protected it is legally. The next step takes place in the laboratory: developing the active pharmaceutical ingredient by synthesizing it into ingredient form. That alone can take several years of trial and error. Once successful, the finished generic has to take the same form as the brand, whether that be pill, capsule, tablet, or injection. Formulating it requires additional ingredients known as excipients, which can be different, but might also be litigated. Then comes testing. In the lab, the in-vitro tests replicate conditions in the body. During dissolution tests, for example, the drug will be put in beakers whose contents mimic stomach conditions, to see how the drugs break down. But some of the most important tests are in-vivo—when the drug is tested on people. Brand-name companies must test new drugs on thousands of patients to prove that they are safe and effective. Generic companies have to prove only that their drug performs similarly in the body to the brand-name drug. To do this, they must test it on a few dozen healthy volunteers and map the concentration of the drug in their blood. The results yield a graph that contains the all-important bioequivalence curve. The horizontal line reflects the time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of drug in the blood. The vertical line reflects the peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in the blood. Between these two axes lies the area under the curve (AUC). The test results must fall in that area to be deemed bioequivalent.\\n\\nMay 29, 2020", "in 1992, the FDA created a complex statistical formula that defined bioequivalence as a range—a generic drug’s concentration in the blood could not fall below 80 percent or rise above 125 percent of the brand name’s concentration. But the formula also required companies to impose a 90 percent confidence interval on their testing, to ensure that less than 20 percent of samples would fall outside the designated range and far more would land within a closer range to the innovator product. After the active ingredients are manufactured, the additional ingredients chosen, and the principal laboratory and clinical tests conducted, the formula then moves to the manufacturing floor to see if it can be made on a commercial scale.\\n\\nMay 29, 2020", "A hospital neurosurgeon looked at the images and confidently told Westerberg, “We’re not going to operate.” He was sure that the swelling and abscesses would abate with effective antibiotic treatment. This confused Westerberg. They had already treated the boy with antibiotics—the intravenous ceftriaxone—and it had failed to beat back his infection. Westerberg’s confusion deepened when his colleague suggested that they switch the boy to a more expensive version of the same drug. “Why swap one ceftriaxone for another?” Westerberg wondered. But he would soon learn that the hospital’s drug supply was plagued by a phenomenon that Ugandan doctors knew all too well. In a world of scarcity, Africa was saturated with Indian- and Chinese-made generic drugs that too often didn’t work. Doctors throughout the continent had adjusted their medical treatment in response, sometimes doubling or tripling recommended doses to produce a therapeutic effect. Many hospitals kept a stash of what they called “fancy drugs”—either brand-name drugs or higher-quality generics—to treat patients who should have recovered after a round of treatment but didn’t. Westerberg’s colleagues were prepared with a backup stash of ceftriaxone purchased outside the hospital. They swapped in the more expensive version and added two more drugs to the boy’s treatment plan. They did not operate fully, but Westerberg did clean out the draining ear. The treatment might have been effective, but was administered too late. The boy never recovered.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "The Ugandan doctors were not surprised by the death of the thirteen-year-old boy. Their patients frequently died when treated with drugs that should have saved them. Even though doctors turned to backup reserves of “fancy” drugs, there were not enough to go around, making every day an exercise in pharmaceutical triage. “We are tired, honestly,” as one doctor in western Uganda put it. She found it hard to keep track of which generics were safe and which were not to be trusted. “It’s anesthesia today, ceftriaxone tomorrow, amoxicillin the next day.”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "In May 2013, he arrived at a manufacturing plant south of Hyderabad, run by an Indian generic company. There, he saw vials of a chemotherapy drug, gemcitabine, which had improperly sealed caps and therefore weren’t sterile. “What the heck did you do with this?” he asked officials. The answer: “We sent it to Africa.” At another plant, he saw drug ingredients that the FDA had restricted from import into the United States and asked where those were headed. The Ukraine, he was told. He passed that information to the Ukrainian government but didn’t hear back.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "One reason he rarely saw a rejected batch in India was that, no matter how evidently defective the drug, there was always some world market where it could be sent.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "What Thakur and Baker had stumbled into was not a glitch or exception but rather common practice in the generic drug industry. The unequal production standards had interchangeable names: “dual-track,” “multi-tier,” or “row A/row B production.” Companies routinely adjusted their manufacturing quality depending on the country buying their drugs. They sent their highest-quality drugs to markets with the most vigilant regulators and their worst drugs to countries with the weakest review. In an industry with slim margins, companies slashed costs by using lower-quality ingredients, fewer manufacturing steps, and lower standards, then sold those drugs in poorly regulated countries. Racism undoubtedly played a role, as it had at Ranbaxy when the medical director said of the poor-quality AIDS drugs bound for Africa, “Who cares? It’s just blacks dying.” But at root, a cold calculation drove the disparate standards: companies could make their cheapest drugs for markets where they would be least likely to get caught. When asked, the companies insisted that they made drugs of different standards because quality standards differed from market to market. But Patrick H. Lukulay, former vice president of global health impact programs for the USP, the world’s top pharmaceutical standard-setting organization, called that argument “totally garbage.” For any given drug, he said, “There’s only one standard, and that standard was set by the originator,” meaning the brand-name company that developed the product.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Westerberg’s colleague brought him a vial of the suspect ceftriaxone from the pharmacy at the Mulago hospital. The drug had been made in China’s Hebei province by an international drug company, CSPC Zhongnuo Pharmaceutical, which also exported to the United States and other developed markets. But when they tested the ceftriaxone at Nickerson’s lab, it contained less than half the active drug ingredient stated on the label. Both Westerberg and Nickerson were shocked. At such low concentration, the drug was basically useless and would not have cured a single patient, said Nickerson. He and Westerberg published a case report in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Although they couldn’t say with certainty that substandard ceftriaxone had killed the boy, their report offered compelling evidence that it had.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Over the past decade, Africa’s pharmaceutical problems changed dramatically. Previously, the continent’s drugs came largely from more-developed countries, through donations and small purchases. The biggest problems were the high costs and resulting scarcity. By 2004, Indian drug reps started arriving throughout Africa, offering cheap generics. In Ghana, though the initial feeling was positive, the result was not, recalled Dr. Anita Appiah, coordinator of community and institutional care for the National Catholic Health Service. Africa became an avenue “to send anything at all,” said Professor Kwabena Ofori-Kwakya, head of the Pharmaceutics Department at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana. The adverse impact on health has been “astronomical,” he said. The poor quality has affected every type of medication. Dr. Gordon Donnir, a psychiatrist who heads the Psychiatry Department at the Komfo Anoyke Teaching Hospital in Kumasi and treats middle-class Ghanaians in his private practice, said that he and his colleagues are bedeviled by low-quality medicine in all sectors. Almost all of the generic drugs he prescribes—olanzapine, risperidone, diazepam—are substandard. The situation has forced him to increase dosages. To treat psychosis, his colleagues from Europe typically prescribe 2.5 milligrams of haloperidol, the generic version of Haldol, several times a day. They are shocked to learn that he’ll prescribe 10 milligrams, three times a day, because he knows that the 2.5 milligram dose “won’t do anything.”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Though data is scarce, in 2012 the Ghana Food and Drugs Authority, with help from the USP and USAID, tested the quality of maternal health drugs on the market. They zeroed in on oxytocin and ergometrine, both essential medicines used to prevent postpartum hemorrhaging. The results were devastating. The report, published in 2013, found that over half of all the oxytocin samples, and almost three-quarters of the ergometrine injection samples, made by various generic companies, failed. All of the ergometrine tablets failed—that is, they produced no effect at all. Some samples contained no active ingredient, and others failed sterility tests, results that pointed to only one conclusion: substandard manufacturing. The drugs, almost all of which came from India and China, were a death sentence for women bleeding due to childbirth. Most of the time, Ghana’s patients have no idea what kind of medicine they take or who manufactures it. The culture in Ghana is faith-based, explained Bright Simons, a technology innovator: “People actually pray [their] medicine will work.”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "In 2008, Alexandra Graham, an African scientist, opened LaGray Chemical Co., a drug manufacturing company outside Ghana’s capital, Accra, with the goal of making high-quality drugs that would follow international standards for good manufacturing practices. Graham, who is Nigerian, and her Ghanaian husband, Paul Lartey, had ideal backgrounds for the effort. They met while working at Abbott Laboratories in Chicago, she as a chemist and manager of the Specialty Products Division, and he, also a chemist, as director of the company’s infectious disease drug discovery unit. Initially, they looked to India’s generic drug industry as a model for manufacturing high-quality drugs in a low-cost environment. It was the model that Dr. Yusuf Hamied at Cipla had set for the world.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Graham resolved to run her business differently, but doing so was a formidable challenge. With unreliable electricity, it was difficult to keep the lights on, much less run complex chemical reactions with sensitive equipment. But the bigger challenge came from competition abroad. With Indian and Chinese drug representatives “aggressively coming into the country,” selling cheap medicine, and “offering all sorts of incentives and bribes,” Graham said, her company struggled to compete. Corrupt local wholesalers even negotiated with the drug companies to sell drugs with reduced amounts of active ingredient, making them cheaper. Seeking help, Graham turned to a respected colleague, the CEO and chairman of a major Indian drug maker. His advice perturbed her. He suggested that she set up one “good factory” capable of producing a “showpiece product” and a second factory that met “local standards.” It became clear to Graham that the idea of high quality at low cost was a myth. Companies that flaunted their factories as “US-FDA inspected” or “WHO-certified” happily sold a cheaper, second-tier product to Africans.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Even if she insisted on making drugs of one high standard only, she couldn’t guarantee that the companies supplying her with active ingredients were doing the same. In 2014, to buy the active ingredients for HIV drugs, Graham turned to the Chinese firm Shanghai Desano, whose factory in Bin hai had been inspected and approved by the WHO. Early in negotiations, a Desano sales rep offered LaGray a discounted product reserved for “African customers.” The ingredients were cheaper, the sales rep explained, because they were not produced at the WHO-approved Binhai plant, but at a clandestine plant in Puxin, China. Graham was furious. She dashed out an email to the company’s vice president, exclaiming, “Whatever is good for any other market is appropriate for Ghana!” Graham’s standards were expensive, and her refusal to prioritize profit over quality did not sit well with her investors, who began to sell their shares. By 2016, her company had closed and the manufacturing plant outside Accra was “overgrown with grasses,” she said. Without strong regulatory reform in Africa, India, and China, she cannot imagine a way to rein in substandard drug production. “The landscape is such that there are no incentives for quality,” she said. “When you’re playing by the rules, you just cannot survive.”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Low-income countries are plagued by poor-quality medicine: counterfeit pills made by criminal gangs and substandard generics made by second-rate drug companies. Though counterfeit drugs look like genuine products, they often contain no active ingredients. By contrast, substandard drugs typically contain active ingredients, but they do not contain enough, or are not formulated well enough, to be effective. Though counterfeit medicine attracts the lion’s share of political outrage and media attention, some experts now argue that substandard drugs are actually a greater threat to public health. Often, substandard drugs do not contain enough active ingredient to effectively treat sick patients. But they do contain enough to kill off the weakest microbes while leaving the strongest intact. These surviving microbes go on to reproduce, creating a new generation of pathogens capable of resisting even fully potent, properly made medicine.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "By 2017, with circumstantial evidence piling up, the nonprofit group USP launched a new center called the Quality Institute, which funds research into the link between drug quality and resistance. In late 2018, that funding bore fruit. Dr. Muhammad Zaman at Boston University coauthored the first study to link substandard drugs to antimicrobial resistance. Working in a laboratory, Zaman studied a commonly used antibiotic called rifampicin. If it’s not manufactured properly, it can yield an impurity as it degrades called rifampicin quinone. When Zaman subjected bacteria to the impurity, it developed mutations that helped it resist rifampicin and other similar drugs. Zaman hopes his laboratory work will help convince policymakers that substandard drugs are an “independent pillar” in the global menace of drug resistance, potentially on par with poor adherence and prescription misuse.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "In Ghana, the technology innovator Bright Simons summed up the stark reality: “All medicines are poisonous. It’s only under the most controlled conditions that they do good.” Only a drug accompanied by data that traces a minute-by-minute path through the manufacturing process can be trusted to work properly. How could anyone guarantee that standard in an underpoliced global marketplace? Only one-tenth of African countries had effective regulators, and two-fifths lacked laboratories capable of routinely testing medicine quality.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Those deficits brought Dr. Patrick H. Lukulay to Ghana’s capital, where he set out to train a generation of African Peter Bakers. In Accra, he ran the Center for Pharmaceutical Advancement and Training (CePAT), an outpost of the USP that opened in 2013. Located down an unpaved dirt lane and set behind a long metal gate, the facility appears unremarkable from the outside. Inside, however, it’s a marvel: door locks are controlled by biometric fingerprint readers, a state-of-the-art microbiology lab is full of costly HPLC machines, and a stability room has specialized refrigerators that test how quickly drugs degrade. The center runs the continent’s only dedicated program for training African drug regulators and also operates a fully accredited laboratory to test drug quality. With these resources, Lukulay hoped to lift the quality of medicine across Africa. It did little good for one country to up its game, said Lukulay, when “its neighbors are all screwed up.” A highly trained scientist with a commanding though kindly air, Lukulay was uniquely suited for his mission in Ghana. He grew up in an impoverished village in Sierra Leone, where his father, the village chief, had twenty-five children. Lukulay studied by kerosene lantern and slept on a bed of palm leaves. Through stellar academic performance and sheer grit, he propelled himself to a school in Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, and ultimately to graduate studies at Michigan State University. He went on to work at Pfizer and Wyeth in the United States before moving to the USP. His childhood experiences left him with an indelible sense of the obstacles in Africa.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "In March 2016, several dozen young regulators who worked for various African governments, including Mozambique, Swaziland, Rwanda, Zambia and Liberia, arrived at CePAT for a training workshop. They spent two weeks learning how to more rigorously vet the dossiers submitted by drug companies and think critically about their claims, as one of their trainers put it, instead of running through a perfunctory checklist. The training program’s graduation ceremony was solemn, to emphasize to the regulators their critical role as the first line of defense against poor-quality medicine. Lukulay’s colleague urged them to “go forth like living water” into Africa, the “ultimate testing laboratory.” Lukulay then stepped forward, wearing a ceremonial outfit of a long tunic, flowing pants, and embroidered cap. “You are soldiers of the state,” he told the graduates. “You have been given ammunition, you have been equipped to do battle with those who want to kill our people.” Expecting them to encounter corruption or political interference at some point, he emphasized that their jobs were “noble” and “ethical.” But most importantly, he emphasized, when they had a dossier before them, they had to ask: “Am I going to check the boxes, or am I going to be a real assessor?”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "a paper published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidologycaught their attention. From 2011 to 2013, one of its coauthors, Preston Mason, a Harvard-affiliated scientist, collected thirty-six samples of generic Lipitor from fifteen countries, manufactured by more than two dozen generic drug companies. When he tested the chemical composition of each, Mason was stunned by his findings: thirty-three of the samples had impurity levels high enough to render them ineffective. Even samples manufactured by the same company but sold in different countries contained widely different impurity levels—proof that some generic companies were making different versions of the same product, a high-quality drug for the West and a poor-quality one for low-income countries. Before long, Mason had joined ranks with Thakur and his new colleagues. What started as a group of like-minded professionals connecting over email briefly became a formal advocacy group, the Safe Medicines Coalition. They tried to alert the public that America’s best public health bargain—low-cost drugs made overseas—had been dangerously compromised through negligent manufacturing and haphazard regulation.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Thakur persisted. He contacted the nongovernmental organizations that purchased medicine in bulk for the world’s poorest patients: the Clinton Foundation, the Global Fund, the Gates Foundation, Doctors Without Borders. These organizations focused on the cost of medicine and the world’s access to it, but in Thakur’s view did not prioritize issues of quality in their purchasing. Thakur asked for meetings. Most did not respond. One operations officer at the Global Fund replied, and Thakur flew from New Delhi to Geneva at his own expense to meet with him. There, he urged the Global Fund to add language to its purchasing contracts stating that medicine had to be of a certain quality. Nothing came of the meeting.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "European Medicines Agency, Europe’s top drug regulator, recommended suspending from the European market seven hundred drugs made by a wide ar ray of manufacturers, which all had one thing in common. The data proving that they were bioequivalent had come from a single Indian company, GVK Biosciences, a contract research organization hired by drug makers to test their medicine on patients. In May 2012, a former employee of GVK Biosciences had written to five inspection agencies around the world, including the U.S. FDA, alleging that the company had routinely manipulated data from patient blood tests to make the drugs appear bioequivalent. The allegations were so detailed and alarming, and implicated so many drugs on world markets, that six weeks later investigators from four regulatory agencies, including the U.S. FDA, visited the company’s clinical pharmacology unit in Hyderabad.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Pant remained in the living room, sipping a glass of wine and chatting with a guest as she reflected on changes in the generic drug industry. She spoke of an important shift in FDA regulations. No longer did it matter who was first, second, or third in line in the FDA parking lot. Now any company that filed on a given day, regardless of the time stamp on their application, could be considered a “first filer” and share in the profits of a drug launch. This had taken a good deal of heat out of the market, with no more pitched tents or limousine campouts. Pant observed, “Too bad all the fun is gone.”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "At an industry conference, Carmelo Rosa, head of the FDA’s Division of International Drug Quality, told the audience that he was injured after his boiler exploded and wound up in the hospital. He refused to take generic drugs from several different manufacturers, all of whom were under scrutiny by the FDA for falsifying data. “I like to pray,” he told his audience. “But we shouldn’t have to be praying for this batch to be a good batch.” An FDA investigator who’d visited Indian plants acknowledged, “Every time I fill a prescription, I think about it.” He believed that low-quality medicine posed the greatest risk for people who took the drugs “day in, day out” for chronic conditions. “The probability is that one of those pills is going to be tainted,” he observed. “You don’t want those impurities in your system.” Thakur’s lawyer Andrew Beato said that, before he got involved in the Ranbaxy case, “I never once looked at the bag or read the damn label.” But that changed after he began to represent Thakur. “From 2007 on, we had a rule in our house going forward. We’d pay I don’t care what” to avoid generic drugs made overseas. Debbie Robertson had come to the same conclusion. “As soon as I started the [Ranbaxy] case, I wouldn’t let anyone in my family take any Indian generics,” she recalled. In Congress, investigator David Nelson asked seven different FDA investigators who’d been in Ranbaxy’s facilities whether they’d be willing to take Ranbaxy drugs. “They all said no,” he recalled. Baker swore off all low-cost generics made overseas after his extraordinary inspections at Wockhardt. “If people actually understood,” he told a colleague, “then no one would take [these drugs].”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "hospitals are now required to pay penalties to Medicare when their patients are readmitted. “If we learn that part of our efforts to prevent readmissions are thwarted by bad drugs, it’s going to be a very important discovery,” he noted. By February 2019, the Massachusetts laboratory had one preliminary finding: the Dr. Reddy’s tacrolimus released its active ingredient very rapidly, compared with the brand. Testing continued.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Though Baker knew his every move, email, and phone call would be monitored by the Chinese government, he felt relieved to have left New Delhi behind. He would no longer be the last man standing between American consumers and unsafe drugs. The manufacturing plants he’d be inspecting in China made mostly active ingredients, not finished doses. Most were not sterile facilities. If something slipped past him, an investigator at the next plant could still catch the problem—at least in theory. Within a month, he arrived at the massive Zhejiang Hisun plant in Taizhou, two hundred miles south of Shanghai, the site of a joint venture with Pfizer, started in 2012, to create high-quality, low-cost medicine under the umbrella of Hisun-Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. The company had seemed like a safe bet: it was China’s largest exporter of drug ingredients to the United States.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Baker, on arriving there, went first to the quality control laboratory. Using the rudimentary Mandarin that he learned in college, he hunted through the forest of Chinese symbols in the computer audit trails for the words “trial injection” and “experimental sample.” Despite Pfizer’s three-year head start, it took him about a day to figure out that the plant was running an alternate and hidden laboratory operation. The plant was secretly pretesting its drug samples and then masking the results, in part by turning off audit trails to leave no evidence of the tests. In one instance, Baker found that technicians had turned off the audit trail on February 6, 2014, at 9:09 a.m., then proceeded to run eighty secret tests. The audit trail was turned back on two days later at 8:54 a.m., and the tests—now rigged and with the outcomes assured—were repeated. Baker found the telltale evidence in the software’s metadata. By the third day of inspection, the plant managers and analysts were well aware of how devastating his inspection might be. When Baker returned from a lunch break to the quality control laboratory, he saw an analyst quickly remove a thumb drive from one of the HPLC machines and slip it into his lab coat. Baker demanded that he hand over the thumb drive, but the man “began running and fled the laboratory premises,” he documented in his inspection report. Fifteen minutes later, a manager returned to offer him the thumb drive, but Baker had no idea whether it was the same one. He noted the incident as a refusal to share records—which was serious enough to get the plant’s drug ingredients blocked from the United States. Baker laid out his findings in a forty-seven-page report. It was a document unlike anything the Chinese drug industry had ever seen. Word of it whipped through China’s manufacturing plants, where the prevailing attitude had long been “we can always fool a foreigner,” as one Western drug executive put it. But Baker was no ordinary foreigner. Two and a half years later, Pfizer ended its partnership with Zhejiang Hisun.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Six weeks after the Zhejian Hisun inspection, Baker went to Dalian in the Liaodong Peninsula and inspected another plant; this one, owned and operated by Pfizer, was making finished doses for the U.S. market. There, too, he found manipulated tests, unreported results, and loose batch records that showed the plant using expired materials. One stack of documents disappeared entirely during his inspection; he found them later on an upper floor, tucked inside a wooden crate. Before long, Baker had carved a wide swath through China. At thirty-four more plants he inspected across the country, he found violations—many of them similarly devastating instances of data manipulation. Baker’s inspections cast a harsh light not just on Chinese drug manufacturing, where fraud was endemic, but also on the FDA’s foreign inspection program. “Every time he puts a foot in a company he’s finding more problems,” as one senior FDA official said of Baker. “What does that say about an inspectional force that’s not finding this?”\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "Already, Peter Baker’s razor-sharp inspections had halted imports and contributed to drug shortages rippling across the country. His findings had placed a question mark over generic drug companies operating overseas. They had also slowed drug approvals. That, in turn, jeopardized FDA funding, which was based in part on how many drug applications the agency approved. Baker’s proposal—to train the FDA’s investigators to look harder and find more violations—threatened even more disruptions. Consequently, some in the agency began to target a different problem: Peter Baker himself.\\n\\nMay 30, 2020", "After Baker’s inspection at the Pfizer-affiliated Zhejiang Hisun plant, the FDA restricted the import of thirty of the plant’s drug products. But fifteen of the drug ingredients were in short supply in the United States, so the agency lifted the restriction on about half of the drugs, including a crucial chemotherapy drug for treating leukemia and breast and ovarian cancers. To Baker, the decision made no sense. According to regulations, the drugs had no place in the U.S. supply. They weren’t good or safe enough. Shortages didn’t change that fact. Drug shortages had become a game, and the FDA was getting played. Companies committing fraud could still protect their bottom line by making drugs in short supply. Those would not be restricted, whether made with dubious methods or not, and could serve as a steady source of business, even if companies were caught making unsafe drugs. “There are no consequences for companies that are shipping substandard product,” Baker observed to a colleague. “It’s a win-lose situation—and [patients] are the losers.”\\n\\nMay 30, 202"]
