book_notes = ["The first suggestion is to spend more time thinking about the right questions to ask. Many of us spend too much time worrying about having the right answers.\\n\\nMay 3, 2017", "questions are just as important as answers, often more so. The simple truth is that an answer can only be as good as the question asked. If you ask the wrong question, you are going to get the wrong answer.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Posing good questions is harder than it might seem. I say this not simply by way of explaining why I asked the wrong question at the dance. Asking good questions is hard because it requires you to see past the easy answers and to focus instead on the difficult, the tricky, the mysterious, the awkward, and sometimes the painful.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "What people think of as the moment of discovery,” Salk observed, “is really the discovery of the question.” It takes time to discover the question, but it is time well spent. Einstein, who was a big believer in the importance of asking questions, famously said that if he had an hour to solve a problem, and his life depended on it, he would spend the first fifty-five minutes determining the proper question to ask. You might want to save a little more time for the solution than Einstein, but you get the point.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Asking good questions is just as important in your personal life. Good friends ask great questions, as do good parents. They pose questions that, just in the asking, show how much they know and care about you. They ask questions that make you pause, that make you think, that provoke honesty, and that invite a deeper connection. They ask questions that don’t so much demand an answer as prove irresistible. Posing irresistible questions, I believe, is an art worth cultivating\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "But if you think about it, Siri, Google, and Watson are remarkable at answering some basic questions, but they are not very good at asking them. Computers are also pretty lousy at interpreting questions that are poorly posed, which leads to my second suggestion: It’s important to listen for good questions. It is a cliché to say that there is no such thing as a bad question.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "You will get, if you haven’t already, some hostile questions in your life—some from strangers, others from colleagues or supervisors or relatives. The trick is to distinguish the hostile ones from the innocent but clumsy ones. Clumsy questions might really be the questioner’s way of seeking to get to know you better, or they could just be the product of anxiety and ignorance, neither of which is morally blameworthy. The only truly bad questions are not really questions at all. They are statements disguised as questions that are meant to be demeaning or designed to trip you up. It’s worth being wary of those “questions,” but I believe it’s also worth remaining open to, and generous toward, all other genuine questions, including the clumsy ones.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Questions are like keys. The right question, asked at the right time, will open a door to something you don’t yet know, something you haven’t yet realized, or something you haven’t even considered—about others and about yourself. What I am suggesting is that the five questions that follow are like five crucial keys on a key ring\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Wait, what?” is first on my list of essential questions because it is an effective way of asking for clarification, and clarification is the first step toward truly understanding something—whether it is an idea, an opinion, a belief, or a business proposal. (It’s probably not a good idea to ask this question in response to a marriage proposal. Just saying.) The “wait” that precedes the “what” could be seen as just a useless rhetorical tic. But I think it’s crucial because it reminds you (and others) to slow down to make sure you truly understand. Too often we fail to pause for clarification, thinking that we understand something before we do. In doing so, we miss the opportunity to grasp the full significance of an idea, an assertion, or an event. Asking “Wait, what?” is a good way to capture, rather than miss, those opportunities.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "We hear or read something, make a quick call, then dismiss those with whom we disagree as ignorant or evil. If we took more time to understand ideas and perspectives, especially new and challenging ones, we might be less dismissive and instead more curious. Even if a better understanding of an idea or perspective doesn’t change your mind, it is likely to make you respect or at least appreciate the person proposing the idea more than you would otherwise.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Counselor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but I wonder if I could ask you to clarify a point.”\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Justice Stevens’ approach to questions illustrates an enduring point: In almost every instance, it is better to ask clarifying questions first and to argue second. Before you advocate for a position, be sure to ask “Wait, what?” Inquiry, in other words, should always precede advocacy\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Asking “I wonder why?” allows you to remain curious about the world, which would have come in handy on my run in the Netherlands. Asking “I wonder if?” allows you to remain engaged with the world and is a way to prompt yourself to try something new. It is also the way to begin thinking about how you might improve the world, or at least your corner of it. Though distinct, these questions are also related. It is hard to ask “I wonder why?” for example, without also eventually asking, “I wonder if?” If this all seems a little mysterious, stay tuned\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Curiosity, it turns out, is conducive to health and happiness, as scores of social scientists have documented. Curious people, not surprisingly, are likely to learn more and to retain more of what they learn. Curious people are likely to be more attractive to others, as people are attracted to those who seem interested in them. Curiosity also leads to empathy, an emotion that seems in short supply today. Curious people are likely to be healthier, and to experience less anxiety in particular, because they see new situations as an opportunity to learn rather than an opportunity to realize that they don’t know enough\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Couldn’t we at least . . . ?” is a good way to get unstuck. It is a way to get past disagreement to form some consensus, as in, “Couldn’t we at least agree?” It’s also a way to get started even when you’re not entirely sure where you will finish, as in: “Couldn’t we at least begin?” No matter its specific form, asking questions that begin with “Couldn’t we at least . . . ?” is the way to make progress.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "To begin, asking “Couldn’t we at least agree?” is a way to find common ground. The key to maintaining healthy and productive relationships is consensus—whether in politics, business, marriage, or friendship. Asking “Couldn’t we at least agree?” especially in the midst of an argument, is a good way to pause, step back, and look for some areas of agreement. After taking a step back and finding some consensus, you might have just what you need to take two steps forward, which is just how progress often works: one step back, two steps forward.\\n\\nMay 9, 2017", "Maybe the result would have been the same, but it’s impossible to know, which is a heavy weight to bear. That’s the problem with not trying—you will never know what the outcome might have been. Even if you think the result would have been the same, that’s only a small comfort. When it comes to helping your friends and family, what you want most is to believe that you tried everything you could to help.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "That is a sad story, I realize, but it has made me even more certain that the attempt is often more important than the result. I am confident, from my own experience, that every time you attempt to lend a hand, or to right a wrong, or to speak up, you will feel better—about the world and about yourself. When you act, you may make a mistake; when you speak, you may say the wrong thing. But it is much better to fail while daring greatly than to be a bystander, to borrow a line from Teddy Roosevelt. If you fail, often the worst thing that can happen is that you will have a funny story to tell. I have never heard a single funny story about failing to try\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "Because it helps break logjams, whether created by disagreement, fear, procrastination, or lethargy, and whether created by external obstacles or internal ones, the question “Couldn’t\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "we at least . . . ?” sparks movement.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "While this is a genuine problem, we should not let the real pitfalls of the savior complex extinguish one of the most humane instincts there is—the instinct to lend a hand. The trick is to help others without believing yourself to be, or acting like you are, their savior.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "All of which is to say that how you help matters just as much as that you do help, which is why it is essential to begin by asking, “How can I help?” If you start with this question, you are asking, with humility, for direction. You are recognizing that others are experts in their own lives, and you are affording them the opportunity to remain in charge, even if you are providing some help.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "By asking her how they could help, she explained, they were allowing her to retain her independence and dignity. In addition to showing respect, asking how you can help is also—not surprisingly—likely to make your assistance more effective. My wife, Katie, asks this question, and pays attention to the answer, as well as anyone I know\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "Patrick ultimately received asylum, and he went on to find a good job in New Jersey and create a new life. A few years later, Patrick asked me to serve as the best man at his wedding. The memory of his wedding still brings tears to my eyes. When I later asked him why he wanted me to be his best man, he said, “Because you were my first friend here. You listened to me.”\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "nudging others to identify, express, and confront their own problems. This is sometimes understandably hard to do, as Atul Gawande describes movingly in Being Mortal , in which he recounts the difficult choices advanced cancer patients must make about their own care. Because facing your own mortality is indescribably difficult, and because doctors naturally want to save patients, it is hard for doctors and patients to have candid discussions about the end of life. But as Gawande points out, cancer patients and their families most need someone to help guide them with candor and compassion. It occurred to me when reading this book that if doctors asked the patients how they could help, before simply pointing out all of the various interventions they could perform, they would in a way force the question, which only the patient can answer: What do you want to do? How do you want to spend what may be your last months of life? How do you want to make that decision—what information would be useful, for example, and who else would you like to include in the conversation?\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "help them and, if so, how. More often than not, they eventually tell me that I can’t really do anything. But in saying this they are already starting to figure out the problem for themselves. What they most needed to do was vent, get some sympathy, and figure out a solution for themselves. The need to vent is not confined to kids. My cousin Tracy, who is as funny as she is wise, told me a story once of coming home after a really frustrating day at work and recounting her day to her boyfriend. Instead of listening to the entire story, her boyfriend immediately started offering ideas about what she could have done to solve her problems. She found this maddening. “I didn’t want him to solve my problems,” she told me. “I just wanted him to listen and understand that I had a crappy day at work.”\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "If you ask friends, family members, or colleagues how you can help, you are not offering to solve their problems with specific suggestions. Instead, you are validating that they have a real problem and letting them know you are available to help, if need be. You are showing both sympathy and empathy, which is sometimes all someone needs. Put differently, in asking how you can help, sometimes you already have.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "more equal footing. You are likely to be open, as you should be, to the possibility that the person you are offering to help will likely have something to offer you in return. After all, you are inviting them to teach you enough about their situation or their lives to enable you to help them. In this way, asking how you can help is an invitation to begin a genuine relationship, one based on the notion of reciprocity\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "In other words, who knows what all of this ultimately means, but our most important task for now is to notice and appreciate the fleeting beauty around us. In my experience, if you offer to help others and leave yourself open to their help in return, you will come to appreciate that, in Frost’s words, “this is love, and nothing else is love.”\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "As our misadventure with Sam illustrates, it is all too easy to lose sight of what truly matters. We may be too caught in routines to pay attention. We may lack confidence in our abilities and focus on largely irrelevant details rather than confront the difficult and challenging work in front of us. We may become so stressed that we become easily distracted or have trouble focusing. In each of these situations, it is useful to ask yourself what truly matters. Doing so can help you dispense with routines, muster the courage to face difficult work, and help you regain enough calm to identify what is truly important. Luckily, it all ended well with Sam, and it eventually became a funny story, though admittedly it took Katie (and her parents) a little while to appreciate the humor in our follies—okay, my follies\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "Admittedly, the Chief was truly exceptional in his ability to cut quickly through reams of information to identify key questions and issues. It is one of the reasons he was such a successful lawyer and selected to be a Supreme Court justice. He was also experienced, unlike the overwhelmed medical resident we met when Sam was born. By the time I clerked for him, the Chief had been on the Court for a couple of decades, so he had plenty of chances to hone his skill. Talent and experience undoubtedly helped him quickly identify what mattered most in the cases he heard. Yet his mindset mattered as well. The Chief approached his whole life the same way he approached cases. He clearly thought about what truly mattered in every facet of his life. The Chief did not like to waste time. Years after clerking for the Chief, I came across a passage in a book by Tim Geithner, who served as treasury secretary under President Obama. The passage reminded me of the Chief.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "I went expecting that I would hear a deeply philosophical lecture about the meaning of life from someone directly confronting his own mortality. Instead, to my surprise, the lecture was extremely practical, detailing ways to save time at work. Professor Pausch’s underlying premise was that you should be as efficient as possible at work so that you can do all of the things outside of work that matter just as much, like spending time with family and friends, or pursuing hobbies and other passions.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", ". In 1997, a year before my dad died, I received an offer to teach law at the University of Virginia. Katie and I were new parents at the time. When I called my parents to tell them about the offer from UVA, my father predictably said I must have learned a lot by playing baseball with him in the backyard. I thought about our son Will. Instead of just laughing off my father’s remark, as I usually did, I told him, not knowing it would be my last chance, “I actually did learn a lot, Pop. I learned what it means to be a good father.” I tried to say more, but he choked up and handed the phone to my mom.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "What I have discovered in reading memorials is that every one of them usually hits on the four areas of life mentioned above: family, friends, work, and acts of kindness\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "I try to think, for example, how I could be a better husband, a better father, a better friend, and a better colleague\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "I remember my mother writing me many letters, often in creative ways on the back of pictures she had painted, or in a spiral on a circular piece of paper. I remember really missing her at one of my little league baseball games. I remember watching a neighbor, who dropped me off at summer camp, pointing to me and clearly explaining to the counselor what was up with me and my mother.\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "What truly mattered was that my mother knew I forgave her. I am tempted to say that forgiving those you love—and letting them know that you forgive them—ought to truly matter to you. But I cannot say for sure, because what truly matters is up to you. My only suggestion is that you regularly ask this question—of others, for sure. But more importantly, you should ask this question of yourself, and you should answer it honestly and fearlessly. If you do, this question won’t just help you get to the bottom of an issue or a problem. It will also help you get to the heart of your life\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "He knew how important it was to get together, and he made sure it happened despite our increasingly complicated schedules, often by asking, “Couldn’t we at least . . . ?” Doug was not just our ring leader, he was also our cheerleader. He believed in his close friends and family more than we believed in ourselves. He never told us what to do, but he always asked how he could help. And help he did. He helped us become better versions of ourselves by asking us irresistible questions about our work, our relationships, our aspirations, and our fears—questions that provoked honest answers and, just like good keys, unlocked what we might have been hiding from others and ourselves. Doug had a vaguely mystical quality to him. To be sure, the daily logistics of life often proved challenging for him. He didn’t use the exact words “Wait, what?” but he asked a form of that question over and again. When we were in law school, for example, I would occasionally need a ride back to our house from Doug. We lived about ten miles away from the law school, out in the country on a small farm. When I would ask Doug what time he planned to head home, he often seemed flummoxed and would ask a version of “Wait, what?”\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so?”\\n\\nMay 10, 2017", "May 10, 2017", "“Wait, what?” is at the root of all understanding. “I wonder . . . ?” is at the heart of all curiosity. “Couldn’t we at least . . . ?” is the beginning of all progress. “How can I help?” is at the base of all good relationships.
