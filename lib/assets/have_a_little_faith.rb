book_notes = ["But religion is built on ritual, and the Reb loved the ritual of going in to work. He had nurtured this congregation from a few dozen families in 1948 to more than a thousand families today. I got the feeling the place had actually grown too big for his liking. There were too many members he didn’t know personally\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "Why? I guess because he didn’t approach the sermon in a traditional way. I would later learn that, while he was trained in a formal, academic style—start at point A, move to point B, provide analysis and supporting references—after two or three tries in front of people, he gave up. They were lost. Bored. He saw it on their faces. So he began with the first chapter of Genesis, broke it down to the simplest of ideas and related them to everyday life. He asked questions. He took questions. And a new style was born.\\n\\nMay 14, 2015", "Over the years, those sermons morphed into gripping performances. He spoke with the cues of a magician, moving from one crescendo to the next, mixing in a Biblical quotation, a Sinatra song, a vaudeville joke, Yiddish expressions, even calling, on occasion, for audience participation (“Can I get a volunteer?”). Anything was fair game.\\n\\nMay 14, 2015", "The most inspirational man I knew only reached his potential by helping a child reach his.\\n\\nMay 14, 2015", "Henry had worshipped his dad...When Henry began smoking in the sixth grade, his father’s only response was: “Don’t never ask me for a cigarette...One night, after Henry brought him dinner, his father looked at him sadly and rasped, “Listen, son, you ever run out of cigarettes, you can have some of mine.” A few weeks later, he was dead.\\n\\nMay 14, 2015", "Finally, having lost his only hero, Henry, the hustler’s son, made a decision: from now on, he would take what he wanted\\n\\nMay 14, 2015", "May 16, 2015", "faith is about doing. You are how you act, not just how you believe.\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "it means you are willing to accept people as they are. Nobody is perfect. Not even Mom and Dad. That’s okay.\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "May 16, 2015", "I wanted Albert Lewis—who was born the same year as Morrie—to last longer. There were so many things I never got to ask my old professor. So many times I told myself, “If I only had a few more minutes…”\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "He was always celebrating what he called “our beautiful faith.” When others said such things, I felt uneasy, not wanting to be lumped in with any group that closely. But seeing him so—what’s the word?—joyous, I guess, at his age, was appealing. Maybe the faith didn’t mean that much to me, but it did to him, you could see how it put him at peace. I didn’t know many people at peace.\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "I found I could share almost anything with Reb. He had a way of looking you in the eye and making you feel the world had stopped and you were all that was in it.\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "Maybe this was his gift to the job. Or maybe it was the job’s gift to him.\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "May 16, 2015", "May 16, 2015", "we were part of each other’s lives. If someone was about to slip, someone else could catch him. “That’s the critical idea behind a congregation. We call it a Kehillah Kedoshah —a sacred community. We’re losing that now. The suburbs have changed things. Everyone has a car. Everyone has a million things scheduled. How can you look out for your neighbor? You’re lucky to get a family to sit down for a meal together.”\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "Still, even in retirement, the Reb had a way of stitching together his own sacred community. Day after day, he would peer through his glasses at a scribbled address book and punch telephone numbers. His home phone, a gift from his grandchildren, had giant black-and-white digits, so he could dial more easily. “Hellooo,” he’d begin, “this is Albert Lewis calling for…” He kept track of people’s milestones—an anniversary, a retirement—and called. He kept track of who was sick or ailing—and called. He listened patiently as people went on and on about their joys or worries. He took particular care to call his oldest congregants, because, he said, “It makes them still feel a part of things.”\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "May 16, 2015", "The Reb didn’t do short. He didn’t do e-mail. “In an e-mail, how can I tell if something is wrong?” he said. “They can write anything. I want to see them. If not, I want to hear them. If I can’t see them or hear them, how can I help them?”\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "The Reb would come to comfort a grieving family. He’d come if a child ran away or if someone got laid off. How nice would that be today if when a job was lost, a Man of God sat at the dinner table and encouraged you? Instead, the idea seems almost archaic, if not invasive. No one wants to violate your “space.”\\n\\nMay 16, 2015", "After the Israelites safely crossed the Red Sea, the Egyptians chased after them and were drowned. God’s angels wanted to celebrate the enemy’s demise. According to the commentary, God saw this and grew angry. He said, in essence: “Stop celebrating. For those were my children, too.” Those were my children, too. “What do you think of that?” the teacher asks us. Someone else answers. But I know what I think. I think it is the first time I’ve heard that God might love the “enemy” as well as us. Years later, I will forget the class, forget the teacher’s name, forget the girl across the room. But I will remember that story.\\n\\nMay 17, 2015", "May 17, 2015", "I don’t think I ever heard him say, “Lemme call you back.” I marveled at how a man who was supposed to be available for so many people could somehow be available for each one of them.\\n\\nMay 17, 2015", "My friends, if we tend to the things that are important in life, if we are right with those we love and behave in line with our faith, our lives will not be cursed with the aching throb of unfulfilled business. Our words will always be sincere, our embraces will be tight. We will never wallow in the agony of ‘I could have, I should have.’ We can sleep in a storm. “And when it’s time, our good-byes will be complete.”\\n\\nMay 17, 2015", "Much of what we called “depression” was really dissatisfaction, a result of setting a bar impossibly high or expecting treasures that we weren’t willing to work for. I knew people whose unbearable source of misery was their weight, their baldness, their lack of advancement in a workplace, or their inability to find the perfect mate, even if they themselves did not behave like one. To these people, unhappiness was a condition, an intolerable state of affairs. If pills could help, pills were taken\\n\\nMay 17, 2015", "Having more does not keep you from wanting more. And if you always want more—to be richer, more beautiful, more well known—you are missing the bigger picture, and I can tell you from experience, happiness will never come.”\\n\\nMay 17, 2015", "It is the largest gathering of humanity on earth and has been called “the world’s largest single act of faith.” Yet for most in my country, it is totally alien. The documentary refers to Kumbh Mela as “being part of something big while doing something small\\n\\nMay 19, 2015", "My worry was wasted. The Reb made no such value judgments. “Our faith tells us to do charitable acts and to aid the poor in our community,” he said. “That is being righteous, no matter who you help.”\\n\\nMay 19, 2015", "May 19, 2015", "But you can touch everything and be connected to nothing. I knew airports better than I knew local neighborhoods. I knew more names in other area codes than I did on my block. The “community” I had joined was the community of the workplace. Friends were through work. Conversation was about work. Most of my socialization came through work\\n\\nMay 19, 2015", "And in recent months, those workplace pillars had been falling down. Friends were laid off. Downsized. They took buyouts. Offices closed. People who were always in one place were no longer there when you called. They sent e-mails saying they were exploring “exciting new options.” I never believed the “exciting” part. And without the work connection, the human ties released,\\n\\nMay 20, 2015", "We promised to keep up, but the promises were not kept. Some people behaved as if unemployment were contagious. Anyhow, without the commonality of work—the complaints, the gossip—how much was there to talk about?\\n\\nMay 20, 2015", "But there’s some people that know me from back when—anytime I make that trip to New York—and when they hear I’m the pastor of a church, all of a sudden, it’s like “I know you gettin’ paid, boy. I know you gettin’ paid. I know you.’” He paused. His voice lowered. “No, I say. You knew me. You knew that person, but you don’t know the person that I’m trying to become.”\\n\\nMay 20, 2015", "He truly was happiest when he could help someone. But I assumed a Man of God had no choice. His religion obliged him toward what Lincoln called “the better angels of our nature.”\\n\\nMay 20, 2015", "You know what I found over the years? When I had a disagreement with someone, and they came to talk to me, I always began by saying, ‘I’ve thought about it. And in some ways maybe you’re right.’ “Now, I didn’t always believe that. But it made things easier. Right from the start, they relaxed. A negotiation could take place. I took a volatile situation and, what’s the word…?” Defused it? “Defused it. We need to do that. Especially with family. “You know, in our tradition, we ask forgiveness from everyone—even casual acquaintances. But with those we are closest with—wives, children, parents—we too often let things linger. Don’t wait, Mitch. It’s such a waste.” He told me a story. A man buried his wife. At the gravesite he stood by the Reb, tears falling down his face. “I loved her,” he whispered. The Reb nodded. “I mean…I really loved her.” The man broke down. “And…I almost told her once.” The Reb looked at me sadly. “Nothing haunts like the things we don’t say.”\\n\\nMay 20, 2015", "May 20, 2015", "But I realized something as I drove home that night: that I am neither better nor smarter, only luckier. And I should be ashamed of thinking I knew everything, because you can know the whole world and still feel lost in it. So many people are in pain—no matter how smart or accomplished—they cry, they yearn, they hurt. But instead of looking down on things, they look up, which is where I should have been looking, too. Because when the world quiets to the sound of your own breathing, we all want the same things: comfort, love, and a peaceful heart.\\n\\nMay 21, 2015", "May 21, 2015", "Back in the sanctuary, the Reb concluded his taped message by saying, “Please love one another, talk to one another, don’t let trivialities dissolve friendships…”\\n\\nMay 21, 2015"]
