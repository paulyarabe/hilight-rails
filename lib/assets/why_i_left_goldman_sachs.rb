book_notes = ["The meetings were hard, but there was something about them I enjoyed. I liked the fact that the firm took its culture so seriously; I liked that we were learning to be so serious about giving clients correct information. This is what the Open Meeting instilled in us: Don’t make things up; don’t exaggerate. Just be up-front. If you don’t know something, be very skillful at finding it out, and that’s good enough. And if you make a mistake, admit it—immediately. (This is something Goldman still tells its analysts: if you make an error, especially when you’re trading, the worst thing you can do is not admit it. Failure to come clean will always turn the mistake into a much bigger monetary loss, and it will also ruin your credibility with clients.)\\n\\nJune 15, 2017", "So, at 7:00 A.M., before the trading day began, or at 6:00 P.M., after it ended, Corey and I would spend hours going over everything. The first priority, he told me, was to use the right terminology. Don’t fudge. Don’t say something that’s 80 percent correct. Say it 100 percent correctly at all times. “No ambiguity, no errors” was his mantra. Over and over again he said, “This stuff needs to come to you cold.”\\n\\nJune 15, 2017", "1. Our clients’ interests always come first. Our experience shows that if we serve our clients well, our own success will follow. 5. We stress creativity and imagination in everything we do. While recognizing that the old way may still be the best way, we constantly strive to find a better solution to a client’s problems. We pride ourselves on having pioneered many of the practices and techniques that have become standard in the industry. 12. We regularly receive confidential information as part of our normal client relationships. To breach a confidence or to use confidential information improperly or carelessly would be unthinkable. 14. Integrity and honesty are at the heart of our business. We expect our people to maintain high ethical standards in everything they do, both in their work for the firm and in their personal lives.\\n\\nJune 17, 2017", "In interviews, I always looked for the same few things. I was not so interested in how much someone knew about finance, or what students’ GPAs were. I was more interested in their judgment and enthusiasm for the business. On Wall Street, it’s very easy to teach someone the theoretical aspects of finance. It’s almost impossible, though, to teach someone good judgment and awareness. Will he know when to ask for help? Will she admit when she’s made a trading error? Will he be willing to work his butt off even if the job isn’t always intellectually challenging, but still needs to be done? Will she be able to juggle several tasks at the same time?\\n\\nJune 17, 2017", "Is he interested in the markets, with a desire to learn more? I always felt that just chatting with someone for five minutes would give me a much better sense for all this than asking hard questions about finance. Most important, though: Was the person pleasant? Did we like him? Would he get along with people? Arrogant budding finance gurus did not often make it through the Goldman interview process. Once we had picked our kids on campus, I always did everything I could to help them get in the door. Admittedly this was biased, but I felt that Stanford kids were better rounded and more easygoing than the Ivy League kids, who could be more serious and cutthroat. I’d seen this contrast between East Coast and West Coast very clearly when I was a summer intern\\n\\nJune 17, 2017", "And what I saw in the summer of 2007 was that, for one day, then two, then three, then for an entire week, Carhart, Iwanowski, and Asness’s excellent black boxes suddenly stopped working. The fundamental problem with computer models for trading securities is that they don’t effectively take the outside world into account. They don’t have human thoughts, so psychology can never figure into their calculations. Unlike Gary Cohn in the commodities pit, they can’t look into the whites of people’s eyes and see their fear. And as Gary discovered so successfully, a large part of trading is based on understanding other traders’ emotions. Are they scared? Are they panicked? In the summer of 2007, fear had started to creep into the markets, and the computer models simply couldn’t pick it up.\\n\\nJune 17, 2017", "“I’m just wondering what’s going to happen if the whole ship goes down,” Doug said. He was talking numbly, still staring, as if he were in a trance. “All these guys in finance making two million a year—where are they going to go? What’s our value to society? What skills have we developed?” He shook his head. “Society doesn’t need us,” he said. “We’ll be lucky if we can find something for eighty grand a year. I’m going to tell my kids to go into the sciences.” It was surreal. On the one hand, we were on a crowded subway; we had to be careful about what we said. I’m sure Doug was as aware as I that some people around us were half-listening, and that the words Goldman Sachs should not be uttered. On the other hand, he was speaking the kind of unfiltered truth you never hear on Wall Street. It really felt like a moment of reckoning, as if the whole industry and the economy were about to die. And in a strange way, our talk on the subway felt like one of those movie scenes where two people are in a plane that’s about to go down, and they can finally say—they have to say—what’s really on their minds.\\n\\nJune 17, 2017", "Having the right investing thesis is only half the battle; knowing when to put the idea into practice is arguably more important.\\n\\nJune 17, 2017", "It happens to be one of the most immutable rules of business. Soft culture matters as much as hard numbers. And if your company’s culture is to mean anything, you have to hang—publicly—those in your midst who would destroy it. It’s a grim image, we know. But the fact is, creating a healthy, high-integrity organizational culture is not puppies and rainbows. And yet, for some reason, too many leaders think a company’s values can be relegated to a five-minute conversation between HR and a new employee. Or they think culture is about picking which words—do we “honor” our customers or “respect” them?—to engrave on a plaque in the lobby. What nonsense.\\n\\nJune 17, 2017", "An organization’s culture is not about words at all. It’s about behavior—and consequences. It’s about every single individual who manages people knowing that his or her key role is that of chief values officer, with Sarbanes-Oxley-like enforcement powers to match. It’s about knowing that at every performance review, employees are evaluated for both their numbers and their values…\\n\\nJune 17, 201"]
