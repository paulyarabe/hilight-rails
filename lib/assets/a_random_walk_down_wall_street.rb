An option on a tulip bulb currently worth 100 guilders, for example, would cost the buyer only about 20 guilders.

Fundamental analysts take the opposite tack, believing that the market is 90 percent logical and only 10 percent psychological. Caring little about the particular pattern of past price movement, fundamentalists seek to determine a stock’s proper value. Value in this case is related to a company’s assets, its expected growth rate of earnings and dividends, interest rates, and risk.

In fact, the study found that when people went along with the group in giving wrong answers, activity increased in the area of the brain devoted to spatial awareness. In other words, it appeared that what other people said actually changed what subjects believed they saw. It seems that other people’s errors actually affect how someone perceives the external world.\\n\\nMay 20, 2017", "As the economic historian Charles Kindleberger has stated, “There is nothing so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.” And as Robert Shiller, author of the best-selling Irrational Exuberance, has noted, the process feeds on itself in a “positive feedback loop.” The initial price rise encourages more people to buy, which in turn produces greater profits and induces a larger and larger group of participants.\\n\\nMay 20, 2017", "People’s choices are motivated instead by the values they assign to gains and losses. Losses are considered far more undesirable than equivalent gains are desirable. Moreover, the language used to present the possible gains and losses will influence the final decision that is made. In psychological terms, this is known as “how the choice is framed.” For example, you are told that a fair coin will be flipped and that if it comes up heads you will be given $100. If the coin comes up tails, however, you must pay $100. Would you accept such a gamble? Most people would say no, even though the gamble is a fair one in the sense that in repeated trials you would end up even. Half the time you would gain $100 and half the time you would lose $100. In mathematical terms, the gamble has an “expected value” of zero, calculated as follows\\n\\nMay 20, 2017", "They are overconfident, get trampled by the herd, harbor illusions of control, and refuse to recognize their investment mistakes. The pets actually look smart in comparison. We have just seen how various aspects of human behavior influence investing. In investing, we are often our worst enemy. As Pogo put it, “We have met the enemy and it is us.” An understanding of how vulnerable we are to our own psychology can help us avoid the stupid investor delusions that can screw up our financial\\n\\nMay 21, 2017", "Lethargy bordering on sloth remains the best investment style. The correct holding period for the stock market is forever.\\n\\nMay 21, 2017", "Moreover, investors are likely to avoid selling stocks or mutual funds that went down, in order to avoid the realization of a loss and the necessity of admitting that they made a mistake. On the other hand, investors are generally willing to discard their winners because that enables them to enjoy the success of being correct. Sometimes, it is sensible to hold on to a stock that has declined during a market meltdown, especially if you have reason to believe the company is still successful. Moreover, you would suffer double the regret if you sold it and the stock subsequently went up. But it makes no sense to hold on to losing stocks such as Enron and WorldCom because of the mistaken belief that if you don’t sell, you have not taken a loss. A “paper loss” is just as real as a realized loss. The decision not to sell is exactly the same as the decision to buy the stock at the current price. Moreover, if you own the stock in a taxable account, selling allows you to take a tax loss, and the government will help cushion the blow by lowering the amount of your taxes. Selling your winners will add to your tax burden.\\n\\nMay 21, 2017", "At the outset, it is important to review what I mean by the term “efficient.” It does not mean that the market is always correct. How could it be? Suppose all stocks are rationally priced as the present (discounted) value of all future cash flows. No one can accurately predict those future flows, and thus market prices must always be wrong. Markets can be efficient even if they sometimes make egregious errors in valuation as they did during the Internet bubble. Markets can be efficient even if many market participants are quite irrational and if markets are often strongly influenced by psychology\\n\\nMay 21, 2017", "first is that markets are amazingly successful devices for reflecting new information rapidly and, for the most part, accurately. The response may not be immediate; sometimes there is underreaction for a short period. But by and large, prices reasonably reflect whatever public knowledge there is about each company. The second feature—and I believe the more important one—is that financial markets do not allow investors to earn above-average returns without accepting above-average risks. I’d like to relate this feature to a well-known story about a professor who believes in efficient markets and a student who come across a $100 bill lying on the ground. As the student stops to pick it up, the professor says, “Don’t bother—if it were really a $100 bill, it wouldn’t be there.” The story illustrates what financial economists usually mean when they say that markets are efficient. We believe that $100 bills are not lying around for the taking, by either the professional or the amateur investor.\\n\\nMay 21, 2017"]
