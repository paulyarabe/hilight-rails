It was executed primarily on U.S. claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was in league with al Qaeda. To be sure, there was more to it than that—politics, oil, and perhaps revenge—but it was the al Qaeda and weapons claims that sealed the deal. Eight years, $800 billion, and nearly 4,500 American deaths later—along with at least 100,000 Iraqi fatalities—it was tempting to consider what might have happened had the purveyors of those claims admitted that they did not in fact “know” them to be true\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "The key to learning is feedback.

Rather than waste time, you can just rush off and bankroll the project or pass the law without having to worry about silly details like whether or not it’ll work.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "Granted, not every scenario lends itself to experimentation, especially when it comes to social issues.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "That’s why it pays to be on the lookout for a “natural experiment,” a shock to the system that produces the sort of feedback you’d get if you could randomly command people to change their behavior.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "A better way to get good feedback is to run a field experiment—that is, rather than trying to mimic the real world in a lab, take the lab mind-set into the real world. You’re still running an experiment but the subjects don’t necessarily know it, which means the feedback you’ll glean is pure. With a field experiment, you can randomize to your heart’s content, include more people than you could ever fit in a lab, and watch those people responding to real-world incentives rather than the encouragements of a professor hovering over them. When done well, field experiments can radically improve how problems get solved\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "Now ask yourself how you came to define the problem as you see it.

Before spending all your time and resources, it’s incredibly important to properly define the problem—or, better yet, re define the problem.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "The first is about problem solving generally. Kobayashi redefined the problem he was trying to solve. What question were his competitors asking? It was essentially: How do I eat more hot dogs? Kobayashi asked a different question: How do I make hot dogs easier to eat? This question led him to experiment and gather the feedback that changed the game. Only by redefining the problem was he able to discover a new set of solution\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "The second lesson to be drawn from Kobayashi’s success has to do with the limits that we accept, or refuse to. Over dinner that night at Cafe Luxembourg, Kobayashi said that when he started training, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the existing Coney Island record of 25⅛ HDB. Why? He reasoned that the record didn’t stand for much since his earlier competitors had been asking the wrong question about eating hot dogs. As he saw it, the record was an artificial barrier.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "All of us face barriers—physical, financial, temporal—every day. Some are unquestionably real. But others are plainly artificial—expectations about how well a given system can function, or how much change is too much, or what kinds of behaviors are acceptable. The next time you encounter such a barrier, imposed by people who lack your imagination and drive and creativity, think hard about ignoring it. Solving a problem is hard enough; it gets that much harder if you’ve decided beforehand it can’t be done. If you doubt the adverse power of artificial limits, here’s a simple test.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "Let’s say you haven’t been exercising and want to get back in the groove. You decide to do some push-ups. How many? Well, it’s been a while, you tell yourself, let me start with 10 . Down you go. When do you start getting mentally and physically tired? Probably around push-up number 7 or 8. Imagine now that you had decided on 20 push-ups instead of 10. When do you start getting tired this time? Go ahead, hit the floor and try it. You probably blasted right past 10 before you even remembered how out of shape you are.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "It takes a truly original thinker to look at a problem that everyone else has already looked at and find a new avenue of attack. Why is this so rare? Perhaps because most of us, when trying to figure out a problem, gravitate toward the nearest and most obvious cause.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "Thinking like a Freak means you should work terribly hard to identify and attack the root cause of problems.\\n\\nNovember 16, 2014", "Consider the kind of questions that kids ask. Sure, they may be silly or simplistic or out of bounds. But kids are also relentlessly curious and relatively unbiased. Because they know so little, they don’t carry around the preconceptions that often stop people from seeing things as they are. When it comes to solving problems, this is a big advantage. Preconceptions lead us to rule out a huge set of possible solutions simply because they seem unlikely or repugnant; because they don’t pass the smell test or have never been tried; because they don’t seem sophisticated enough. * But remember, it was a child who finally pointed out that the Emperor’s new clothes were in fact no clothes at all.\\n\\nJune 4, 2016", "Granted, sorting bad ideas from good isn’t easy. (One trick that works for us is a cooling-off period. Ideas nearly always seem brilliant when they’re hatched, so we never act on a new idea for at least twenty-four hours. It is remarkable how stinky some ideas become after just one day in the sun.) In the end, you may find that only one idea out of twenty is worth pursuing—but you might never have come up with that one unless you were willing to blurt out, childlike, everything that wandered through your brain.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "To think like a Freak means to think small, not big. Why? For starters, every big problem has been thought about endlessly by people much smarter than we are. The fact that it remains a problem means it is too damned hard to be cracked in full. Such problems are intractable, hopelessly complex, brimming with entrenched and misaligned incentives. Sure, there are some truly brilliant people out there and they probably should think big. For the rest of us, thinking big means you’ll spend a lot of time tilting at windmills. While thinking small won’t win you many points with the typical big thinker, there are at least a few noteworthy advocates of our approach. Sir Isaac Newton, for instance. “To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age,” he wrote. “Tis much better to do a little with certainty and leave the rest for others that come after than to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing.”\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "November 17, 2014", "Freaks like to have fun. This is another good reason to think like a child. Kids aren’t afraid to like the things they like. They don’t say they want to go to the opera when they’d rather play video games. They don’t pretend they’re enjoying a meeting when they really want to get up and run around. Kids are in love with their own audacity, mesmerized by the world around them, and unstoppable in their pursuit of fun. But in one of the strangest wrinkles of human development, these traits magically evaporate in most people by their twenty-first birthday. There are certain realms in which having fun, or even looking like you’re having fun, is practically forbidden. Politics, for one; academia too.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "From what we’ve seen personally, the best predictor of success among young economists and journalists is whether they absolutely love what they do. If they approach their job like—well, a job —they aren’t likely to thrive. But if they’ve somehow convinced themselves that running regressions or interviewing strangers is the funnest thing in the world, you know they have a shot\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "Perhaps the arena most in need of a fun injection is public policy. Think about how policymakers generally try to shape society: by cajoling, threatening, or taxing people into behaving better. The implication is that if something is fun—gambling or eating cheeseburgers or treating the presidential election like a horse race—then it must be bad for us. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Rather than dismiss the fun impulse, why not co-opt it for the greater good? Consider this problem: Americans are infamously bad at saving money. The personal savings rate is currently about 4 percent. We all know it’s important to put away money for emergencies and education and retirement. So why don’t we do it? Because it’s a lot more fun to spend money than to lock it up in a bank! Meanwhile, Americans spend roughly $60 billion a year on lottery tickets\\n\\nJune 4, 2016", "If there is one mantra a Freak lives by, it is this: people respond to incentives\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "Cash incentives, with all their limitations and wrinkles, are plainly not perfect. But here’s the good news: it is often possible to elicit the behavior you want through nonfinancial means. And it’s a lot cheaper too. How to do this? The key is to learn to climb inside other people’s minds to figure out what really matters to them.  Theoretically, this shouldn’t be so hard. We all have a lot of practice thinking about how we respond to incentives. Now it’s time to sit on the other side of the table, as in a good marriage, to understand what someone else wants. Yes, it may be money they’re after—but just as often they are motivated by wanting to be liked, or not be hated; by wanting to stand out in a crowd, or perhaps not stand out.\\n\\nJune 4, 2016", "simply asking people what they want or need doesn’t necessarily work. Let’s face it: human beings aren’t the most candid animals on the planet. We’ll often say one thing and do another—or, more precisely, we’ll say what we think other people want to hear and then, in private, do what we want.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "declared preferences and revealed preferences, and there is often a hefty gap between the two. When trying to figure out what kind of incentive will work in a given situation, it is crucial to keep your eye on this gap. (Thus the old saying: Don’t listen to what people say; watch what they do. ) Furthermore, it’s often the case that when you most desperately want to know someone else’s incentives—in a negotiation, for instance—your incentives and theirs are at odds.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "November 17, 2014", "You may not like this idea; none of us wants to admit that we are pack animals. But in a complicated world, running with the herd can make sense. Who has time to think through every decision and all the facts behind it? If everybody around you thinks that conserving energy is a good idea—well, maybe it is. So if you are the person designing an incentive scheme, you can use this knowledge to herd people into doing the right thing—even if they’re doing it for the wrong reasons\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "you’d simply observe that people are complicated creatures, with a nuanced set of private and public incentives, and that our behavior is enormously influenced by circumstances. Once you understand how much psychology is at work when people process incentives, you can use your wiles to create incentive plans that really work—either for your own benefit or, if you prefer, for the greater good.\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "November 17, 2014", "n a small village in Vietnam, there was one kid who played soccer every day with the Smile Train volunteers. They started calling him Soccer Boy. When the mission was over and the Americans were driving away, Mullaney saw Soccer Boy chasing after their bus, his cleft lip still unrepaired. “We were in shock—how could he not have been helped?” As a humanitarian, it hurt; as a businessman, it rankled. “What store,” he asks, “turns away 80 percent of its customers?” Mullaney helped conceive a new business model for Operation Smile. Rather than raise millions of dollars to fly doctors and surgical equipment around the world for limited engagements, what if the money were instead used to equip local doctors to perform cleft surgery year-round?\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "The leadership of Operation Smile, however, wasn’t as keen about this plan. So Mullaney left to help start a new group, Smile Train. By now he had sold off his ad agency (for eight figures, thank you very much) and devoted himself to fixing the smile of every last Soccer Boy and Girl he could locate. He also wanted to change the face of the non-profit industry itself, “the most dysfunctional $300 billion industry in the world,” as he saw it. Mullaney had come to believe that too many philanthropists engage in what Peter Buffett, a son of the über-billionaire Warren Buffett, calls “conscience laundering”—doing charity to make themselves feel better rather than fighting to figure out the best ways to alleviate suffering\\n\\nNovember 17, 2014", "Smile Train was phenomenally successful. Over the next fifteen years, it helped provide more than 1 million surgeries in nearly 90 countries, all with a worldwide staff of fewer than 100. A documentary film called Smile Pinki, which Mullaney helped produce, won an Academy Award. Not coincidentally, Mullaney had turned the organization into a fund-raising juggernaut, taking in nearly $1 billion all told. The skills that had been useful as an ad man were useful as a fund-raiser too—targeting potential donors, honing the Smile Train message, and pitching its mission with just the right blend of pathos and verve.

He was selling a product (in Smile Train’s case, a sad story) and the donor was buying (a happy ending). The once-and-done campaign changed that. Rather than hound donors with a hard sell, Smile Train changed its message: Hey, we know it’s a hassle to get eighteen letters a year. You think we like having to send out that many? But we’re all in this fight together, so why don’t you send us a few bucks and we can be done with it? Voilà!

Whenever possible, create incentives that switch the frame from adversarial to cooperative. 5. Never, ever think that people will do something just because it is the “right” thing to do. 6.
