book_notes = ["Good design at its core is about understanding people and their needs in order to create the best possible tools for them. I’m drawn to design for a lot of the same reasons that I’m drawn to management—it feels like a deeply human endeavor to empower others.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "working together in teams is how the world moves forward. We can create things far grander and more ambitious than anything we could have done alone. This is how battles are won, how innovation moves forward, how organizations succeed. This is how any remarkable achievement happens.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "the crux of management: It is the belief that a team of people can achieve more than a single person going it alone. It is the realization that you don’t have to do everything yourself, be the best at everything yourself, or even know how to do everything yourself.Your job, as a manager, is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "If the job is defined as getting better outcomes from a group of people working together, then a great manager’s team will consistently achieve great outcomes.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "You can be the smartest, most well-liked, most hardworking manager in the world, but if your team has a long-standing reputation for mediocre outcomes, then unfortunately you can’t objectively be considered a “great” manager.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "A great manager might be asked to lead a new team, and because it takes her time to ramp up, her results might be unimpressive at the beginning. On the flip side, a bad manager might achieve a few quarters of amazing results because she inherited a talented team or set high-pressure ultimatums that had people burning the midnight oil.Time, however, always reveals the truth. The best employees don’t tend to stick around for years and years under a boss who treats them poorly or whom they don’t respect. And talented managers can typically turn around poor-performing teams if they are empowered to make changes.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Six years ago, I switched my reporting to a different manager, Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer. One of the earliest conversations I remember us having is when I asked him how he evaluates the job of a manager. He smiled and said, “My framework is quite simple.” Half of what he looked at was my team’s results—did we achieve our aspirations in creating valuable, easy-to-use, and well-crafted design work? The other half was based on the strength and satisfaction of my team—did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together?The first criterion looks at our team’s present outcomes; the second criterion asks whether we’re set up for great outcomes in the future.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "think of the multitude of tasks that fill up a manager’s day as sorting neatly into three buckets: purpose, people, and process.The purpose is the outcome your team is trying to accomplish, otherwise known as the why. Why do you wake up and choose to do this thing instead of the thousands of other things you could be doing? Why pour your time and energy into this particular goal with this particular group of people? What would be different about the world if your team were wildly successful? Everyone on the team should have a similar picture of why does our work matter?\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "The first big part of your job as a manager is to ensure that your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Getting everyone to understand and believe in your team’s purpose, whether it’s as specific as “make every customer who calls feel cared for” or as broad as “bring the world closer together,” requires understanding and believing in it yourself, and then sharing it at every opportunity—from writing emails to setting goals, from checking in with a single report to hosting large-scale meetings.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "The next important bucket that managers think about is people, otherwise known as the who. Are the members of your team set up to succeed? Do they have the right skills? Are they motivated to do great work?If you don’t have the right people for the job, or you don’t have an environment where they can thrive, then you’re going to have problems.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Finally, the last bucket is process, which describes how your team works together. You might have a superbly talented team with a very clear understanding of what the end goal is, but if it’s not apparent how everyone’s supposed to work together or what the team’s values are, then even simple tasks can get enormously complicated. Who should do what by when?\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "We’ve already established that when you are working by yourself, you get to make all the decisions. You are limited only by how fast you can think and act.In a team setting, it’s impossible for a group of people to coordinate what needs to get done without spending time on it.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "For managers, important processes to master include running effective meetings, future proofing against past mistakes, planning for tomorrow, and nurturing a healthy culture.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Purpose, people, process. The why, the who, and the how. A great manager constantly asks herself how she can influence these levers to improve her team’s outcomes. As the team grows in size, it matters less and less how good she is personally at doing the work herself. What matters more is how much of a multiplier effect she has on her team.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Training isn’t the only thing I can do. What if I used those thirty hours to recruit my neighbor Toby? He’s so persuasive he could convince a leopard to buy spots.* Suppose my “lemonade stand on every block” vision inspires him to join the team. He ends up selling thirty cups of lemonade an hour, putting all our skills to shame. In a year, that means our stand will see an additional 21,000-plus cups sold!If I spend all my time personally selling lemonade, then I’m contributing an additive amount to my business, not a multiplicative one. My performance as a manager would be considered poor because I’m actually operating as an individual contributor.When I decided to train Henry and Eliza, my efforts resulted in slightly more lemonade output, so I had a small multiplier effect. I’m on the right track, but it’s nothing to write home about. When I hired Toby, it resulted in a much bigger multiplier effect.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Do I Find It More Motivating to Achieve a Particular Outcome or to Play a Specific Role?As a manager, you are judged on your team’s outcomes, so your job is to do whatever most helps them succeed. If your team is lacking key skills, then you need to spend your time training or hiring. If someone is creating problems for others, then you need to get him to stop. If people don’t know what they should be doing, then you need to construct a plan. A lot of this work is unglamorous. But because it’s important, it must be done, and if nobody else does it, then it falls to you.This is why adaptability is a key trait of great managers. As your team changes—whether it’s goals shifting, people joining or leaving, or processes evolving—what you do every day will also change. If you’re committed to your purpose, then you will probably enjoy (or at least not mind) the variation that comes with the job. If, instead, there is a specific activity that you love too much to give up—whether it’s seeing patients, teaching students, writing code, or designing products—then you may find your personal goals at odds with what the team needs most.This question is more important than any other on the list, and a strong yes can make up for almost anything, which is why you see leaders with vastly different strengths and temperaments helming companies.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "I learned then one of my first lessons of management—the best outcomes come from inspiring people to action, not telling them what to do.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "“What makes a good leader is that they eschew the spotlight in favor of spending time and energy to do what they need to do to support and protect their people,” writes Simon Sinek in Leaders Eat Last. In return, “We offer our blood and sweat and tears and do everything we can to see our leader’s vision come to life.”Now, a manager who doesn’t know how to influence others isn’t going to be particularly effective at improving the outcomes of her team. So to be a great manager, one must certainly be a leader.A leader, on the other hand, doesn’t have to be a manager. Anyone can exhibit leadership, regardless of their role.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "This is an important distinction because while the role of a manager can be given to someone (or taken away), leadership is not something that can be bestowed. It must be earned. People must want to follow you.You can be someone’s manager, but if that person does not trust or respect you, you will have limited ability to influence him. I did not suddenly become a “leader” the day my title officially changed. On the contrary, some of my reports were initially skeptical, and it took time for us to develop a strong relationship.In your early days as a manager, what matters most is transitioning gracefully into the role and nailing the essentials of leading a small team. Only when you have built trust with your reports will you have the credibility to help them achieve more together.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Taking the time to reflect on the biggest opportunities for improvement helps you understand how to best act as a multiplier for your team.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Unfortunately, the mistake that I made—and that I see virtually every apprentice manager make—is continuing to do individual contributor work past the point at which it is sustainable.When my team became six or so, I was still the lead designer for a complex project that demanded many hours of the week. Because my management responsibilities were also growing, every time something out of the ordinary happened—a report needed extra one-on-one attention or our team had multiple reviews to prepare for that week—I wouldn’t have enough time to devote to my own project. The quality of my work suffered, my peers got frustrated, and the balls I was desperately trying to juggle plopped to the ground.I finally realized that I had to give up wanting to be both a design manager and a designer, because in attempting to do both, I was doing neither well. Don’t learn this the hard way—at the point in which your team becomes four or five people, you should have a plan for how to scale back your individual contributor responsibilities so that you can be the best manager for your people.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "Outside of your organization, finding a group of leaders in similar roles at other places can provide you with an invaluable network of support. My friend who is an entrepreneur swears by what he calls “informal CEO training” from casual dinners he attends with other founders.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "During a particularly active discussion around a go-to-market plan, a new manager on my team once piped up, “Excuse me—I’m new, so pardon the question—but can someone please explain what we’re hoping to achieve with this launch?”That question led the room to stop and take a step back. Having gotten so caught up in the launch details, we realized we needed to make sure we were all aligned on the broader goal first. At the end of the discussion, a long-tenured team member said admiringly to the new manager, “I hadn’t even connected the dots on what we cared about, so your question was awesome.”\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "In your first few one-on-one meetings, ask your reports the following questions to understand what their “dream manager” looks like.What did you and your past manager discuss that was most helpful to you?What are the ways in which you’d like to be supported?How do you like to be recognized for great work? What kind of feedback is most useful for you? Imagine that you and I had an amazing relationship. What would that look like?\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "In your first few months, your primary job is to listen, ask questions, and learn.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2022", "most successors are surprised by the extent of what they’ve inherited. “I had no idea the lengths my former manager went to to shield us from the many requests from other teams,” a colleague told me in amazement after she became the successor. “I’m getting contacted left and right every day, and I realize now how much work he did behind the scenes to take care of things.”Don’t be too hard on yourself, and ask for support from your new manager as well as others around you (more on that in Chapter Five: Managing Yourself). It’s also helpful to be up front with your colleagues that they should expect a period of transition as you ramp up. One friend shared his most repeated line in those early weeks: “Our last manager left big shoes to fill, and while I’ll do my best, I expect I’ll go through a few bumps along the way. I want to ask you for your help and support during this period.” Setting the stage explicitly like that lets others understand what you’re going through and offer aid as you adjust to your new scope.\\n\\nFebruary 27, 202"]
