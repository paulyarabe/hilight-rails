The goal is the specific outcome that players will work to achieve. It focuses their attention and continually orients their participation throughout the game. The goal provides players with a sense of purpose . The rules place limitations on how players can achieve the goal. By removing or limiting the obvious ways of getting to the goal, the rules push players to explore previously uncharted possibility spaces. They unleash creativity and foster strategic thinking . The feedback system tells players how close they are to achieving the goal. It can take the form of points, levels, a score, or a progress bar. Or, in its most basic form, the feedback system can be as simple as the players’ knowledge of an objective outcome: “The game is over when . . .” Real-time feedback serves as a promise to the players that the goal is definitely achievable, and it provides motivation to keep playing. Finally, voluntary participation requires that everyone who is playing the game knowingly and willingly accepts the goal, the rules, and the feedback. Knowingness establishes common ground for multiple people to play together. And the freedom to enter or leave a game at will ensures that intentionally stressful and challenging work is experienced as safe and pleasurable activity.\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "Everything else is an effort to reinforce and enhance these four core elements. A compelling story makes the goal more enticing. Complex scoring metrics make the feedback systems more motivating. Achievements and levels multiply the opportunities for experiencing success. Multiplayer and massively multiplayer experiences can make the prolonged play more unpredictable or more pleasurable. Immersive graphics, sounds, and 3D environments increase our ability to pay sustained attention to the work we’re doing in the game. And algorithms that increase the game’s difficulty as you play are just ways of redefining the goal and introducing more challenging rules. Bernard Suits, the late, great philosopher, sums it all up in what I consider the single most convincing and useful definition of a game ever devised: Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.\\n\\nApril 28, 2015", "Compared with games, reality is too easy.

If you weren’t playing a game, you’d achieve this goal the most efficient way possible: you’d walk right up to each hole and drop the ball in with your hand. What makes golf a game is that you willingly agree to stand really far away from each hole and swing at the ball with a club. Golf is engaging exactly because you, along with all the other players, have agreed to make the work more challenging than it has any reasonable right to be. Add to that challenge a reliable feedback system—you have both the objective measurement of whether or not the ball makes it into the hole, plus the tally of how many strokes you’ve made—and you have a system that not only allows you to know when and if you’ve achieved the goal, but also holds out the hope of potentially achieving the goal in increasingly satisfying ways: in fewer strokes, or against more players. Golf is, in fact, Bernard Suits’ favorite, quintessential example of a game—it really is an elegant explanation of exactly how and why we get so thoroughly engaged when we play\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "As you successfully lock in Tetris puzzle pieces, you get three kinds of feedback: visual— you can see row after row of pieces disappearing with a satisfying poof; quantitative —a prominently displayed score constantly ticks upward; and qualitative —you experience a steady increase in how challenging the game feels.\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "This variety and intensity of feedback is the most important difference between digital and nondigital games. In computer and video games, the interactive loop is satisfyingly tight. There seems to be no gap between your actions and the game’s responses. You can literally see in the animations and count on the scoreboard your impact on the game world. You can also feel how extraordinarily attentive the game system is to your performance. It only gets harder when you’re playing well, creating a perfect balance between hard challenge and achievability. In other words, in a good computer or video game you’re always playing on the very edge of your skill level, always on the brink of falling off. When you do fall off, you feel the urge to climb back on. That’s because there is virtually nothing as engaging as this state of working at the very limits of your ability—or what both game designers and psychologists call “flow.” 4 When you are in a state of flow, you want to stay there: both quitting and winning are equally unsatisfying outcomes\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "Players begin each game by tackling the obstacle of not knowing what to do and not knowing how to play . This kind of ambiguous play is markedly different from historical, predigital games. Traditionally, we have needed instructions in order to play a game. But now we’re often invited to learn as we go. We explore the game space, and the computer code effectively constrains and guides us. We learn how to play by carefully observing what the game allows us to do and how it responds to our input. As a result, most gamers never read game manuals. In fact, it’s a truism in the game industry that a well-designed game should be playable immediately, with no instruction whatsoever\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "It used to be that we were spoon-fed the goal and the rules, and we would then seek feedback on our progress.

If we were to reverse these two traits, we’d get something like this: an optimistic sense of our own capabilities and an invigorating rush of activity . There’s no clinical psychological term that describes this positive condition. But it’s a perfect description of the emotional state of gameplay. A game is an opportunity to focus our energy, with relentless optimism, at something we’re good at (or getting better at) and enjoy. In other words, gameplay is the direct emotional opposite of depression.\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "If only hard work in the real world had the same effect. In our real lives, hard work is too often something we do because we have to do it—to make a living, to get ahead, to meet someone else’s expectations, or simply because someone else gave us a job to do. We resent that kind of work. It stresses us out. It takes time away from our friends and family. It comes with too much criticism. We’re afraid of failing. We often don’t get to see the direct impact of our efforts, so we rarely feel satisfied. Or, worse, our real-world work isn’t hard enough. We’re bored out of our minds. We feel completely underutilized. We feel unappreciated. We are wasting our lives. When we don’t choose hard work for ourselves, it’s usually not the right work, at the right time, for the right person. It’s not perfectly customized for our strengths, we’re not in control of the work flow, we don’t have a clear picture of what we’re contributing to, and we never see how it all pays off in the end. Hard work that someone else requires us to do just doesn’t activate our happiness systems in the same way. It all too often doesn’t absorb us, doesn’t make us optimistic, and doesn’t invigorate us.\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "What a boost to global net happiness it would be if we could positively activate the minds and bodies of hundreds of millions of people by offering them better hard work. We could offer them challenging, customizable missions and tasks, to do alone or with friends and family, whenever and wherever. We could provide them with vivid, real-time reports of the progress they’re making and a clear view of the impact they’re having on the world around them. That’s exactly what the game industry is doing today. It’s fulfilling our need for better hard work—and helping us choose for ourselves the right work at the right time. So you can forget the old aphorism “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” All good gameplay is hard work. It’s hard work that we enjoy and choose for ourselves. And when we do hard work that we care about, we are priming our minds for happiness.\\n\\nApril 19, 2015", "HIGH-STAKES WORK, busywork, mental work, physical work, discovery work, teamwork, and creative work—with all this hard work going on in our favorite games, I’m reminded of something the playwright Noël Coward once said: “Work is more fun than fun.”\\n\\nApril 20, 2015", "We’d be much better off avoiding easy fun and seeking out hard fun , or hard work that we enjoy, instead.

The computer algorithms continuously adjusted the difficulty level to keep you playing at the very edge of your own abilities.

Thirty seconds of play, and I’m on a whole new plane of being, all my synapses wailing. 9 What Sudnow describes is the extreme neurochemical activation that happens in our brains and bodies when we start to play a good computer or video game.

We’re not looking for praise or payouts. The very act of what we’re doing, the enjoyment of being fully engaged, is enough. The scientific term for this kind of self-motivated, self-rewarding activity is autotelic (from the Greek words for “self,” auto , and “goal,” telos). 17 We do autotelic work because it engages us completely, and because intense engagement is the most pleasurable, satisfying, and meaningful emotional state we can experience.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "individuals who focused on intrinsically rewarding activity, working hard to develop their personal strengths and build social relationships, for example, were measurably happier over the entire two-year period completely regardless of external life circumstances like salary or social status.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "happiness derived from intrinsic reward is incredibly resilient.

If we laugh or smile, too, the effect is even more pronounced. 21 Every time we coordinate or synchronize our physical movements with others, such as in dance or sports, we release oxytocin into our bloodstream, a neurochemical that makes us feel blissed out and ecstatic. 22 When we seek out what we might describe as “powerful” and “moving” stories, media, or live performances, we’re actually triggering our vagus nerve, which makes us feel emotionally “choked up” in our chests and throats, or we’re firing up our nervous system’s pilomotor reflex, which gives us pleasurable chills and goose bumps. 23\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "First and foremost, we crave satisfying work , every single day.

More than anything else, it’s the feeling of “blissful productivity” that the game provokes. 5 Blissful productivity is the sense of being deeply immersed in work that produces immediate and obvious results. The clearer the results, and the faster we achieve them, the more blissfully productive we feel. And no game gives us a better sense of getting work done than WoW. Your primary job in World of Warcraft is self-improvement—a kind of work nearly all of us find naturally compelling. You have an avatar, and your job is to make that avatar better, stronger, and richer in as many different ways as possible: more experience, more abilities, stronger armor, more skills, more talent, and a bigger reputation. Each of these improvable traits is displayed in your avatar profile, alongside a point value. You improve yourself by earning more points, which requires managing a constant work flow of quests, battles, and professional training.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "The more points you earn, the higher your level, and the higher your level, the more challenging work you unlock. This process is called “leveling up.” The more challenging the work, the more motivated you are to do it, and the more points you earn . . . It’s a virtuous circle of productivity. As Edward Castronova, who is a leading researcher of virtual worlds, puts it, “There is zero unemployment in World of Warcraft .” 6 The WoW work flow is famously designed so that there is always something to do, always different ways to improve your avatar.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "Between the high-stakes work, the exploratory work, the busywork, the teamwork, and the strategic work, the hours of work definitely add up. There’s so much to do, the typical WoW player puts in as many hours weekly as a part-time job. All in all, it takes the average WoW player a total of five hundred hours of gameplay to develop his or her avatar to the game’s current maximum level, which is where many players say the fun really starts. 7 Now that’s a labor of love. So how exactly does a game convince a player to spend five hundred hours playing it just to get to the “fun” part? For some players, it’s the promise of ultimate challenge that makes the incredible workload worth it. At the highest levels of the game, you get to experience the extreme adrenaline rush of what players call the “endgame.” Players who crave high-stakes work and extreme mental activation level up as fast as they can to reach the endgame, because that’s where the most challenging opponents and the hardest work—in other words, the most invigorating, confidence-building gameplay—is available.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "Satisfying work always starts with two things: a clear goal and actionable next steps toward achieving that goal.

Then it’s not work—it’s a problem . Now, there’s nothing wrong with having interesting problems to solve; it can be quite engaging. But it doesn’t necessarily lead to satisfaction. In the absence of actionable steps, our motivation to solve a problem might not be enough to make real progress. Well-designed work, on the other hand, leaves no doubt that progress will be made. There is a guarantee of productivity built in, and that’s what makes it so appealing.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "In The How of Happiness , Sonja Lyubomirsky writes that the fastest way to improve someone’s everyday quality of life is to bestow on a person a specific goal , something to do and to look forward.” 10 When a clear goal is attached to a specific task, she explains, it gives us an energizing push, a sense of purpose.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "The real payoff for our work in WoW is to be rewarded with more opportunities for work. The design of the work flow is key here: the game constantly challenging you to try something just a little bit more difficult than what you’ve just accomplished. These microincreases in challenge are just big enough to keep sparking your interest and motivation—but never big enough to create anxiety or the sense of an ability gap. As one longtime World of Warcraft player explains, “When accepting a quest, you rarely have to question if you can complete it; you just need to figure out when you can fit it into your jam-packed hero schedule.” 11 This endless series of goals and actionable steps is exactly what makes World of Warcraft so invigorating\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "Long before we ever earned any money, we were aware of the necessity of keeping busy: we knew the satisfaction of stacking bricks, pouring water into and out of containers and moving sand from one pit to another, untroubled by the greater purpose of our actions.” 19 In casual games, there is no greater purpose to our actions—we are simply enjoying our ability to make something happen.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "Positive failure feedback reinforces our sense of control over the game’s outcome. And a feeling of control in a goal-oriented environment can create a powerful drive to succeed.\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "It helps, of course, that gamers believe they have every chance of success when they sit down to play a new game. Justifiable optimism is built right in to the medium. By design, every computer and video game puzzle is meant to be solvable, every mission accomplishable, and every level passable by a gamer with enough time and motivation. But without positive failure feedback, this belief is easily undermined. If failure feels random or passive, we lose our sense of agency—and optimism goes down the drain. As technology journalist Clive Thompson reminds us, “It’s only fun to fail if the game is fair—and you had every chance of success.” 5 That’s why Nicole Lazzaro spends so much time consulting with game developers about how, exactly, to design failure sequences that are spectacular and engaging. The trick is simple, but the effect is powerful:\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "With games, learning is the drug.” And that’s why fun in games lasts only as long as we’re not consistently successful . 7 It’s something of a paradox. Games are designed for us to learn them, get better at them, and eventually be successful. Any gamer who puts in the effort can’t help but get better. And yet the better we are at a game, the less of a challenge it presents. Harder levels and tougher challenges can keep the feeling of “hard fun” alive for a while. But if we keep playing, we keep getting better—and so it’s inevitable: the unnecessary obstacle becomes less of an obstacle over time. That’s why, Koster says, “the destiny of games is to become boring, not to be fun. Those of us who want games to be fun are fighting a losing battle against the human brain.” 8 Fun will always morph into boredom, once we pass the critical point of being reliably successful. This is what makes games consumable : players wring all the learning (and fun) out of them\\n\\nApril 21, 2015", "Fun failure is a way to prolong the game experience and stretch out the learning process.

For instance, each player in your band can select a different difficulty level, meaning your experienced drummer can play on hard while your vocalist scrapes by on medium and your beginner guitarist takes it easy.

You know instantly that you’re off the beat or getting your chords wrong, and it’s easy to identify exactly where you’re getting tripped up. When you’re the singer, you can watch the musical staff to see if you’re perfectly on pitch, sharp, or flat.

This tiny provocation has two powerful effects. First, it confirms trust: the person doing the teasing is demonstrating the capacity to hurt, but simultaneously showing that the intention is not to hurt. Just like a dog might play-bite another dog to show that it wants to be friends, we bare our teeth to each other in order to remind each other that we could, but never really would, hurt each other.

The players can recognize each other because they have a common understanding of what they’re doing and why. Their actions are intelligible and meaningful to each other.

Here’s an example of one of the free-verse poems that two players created as their final score together: Rougemont, making wedding pictures, tango in a barn, Bend paper clips, cinnamon buns, tongue of a cow, In a skirt, in the Pacific, putting together a darkroom. Each phrase of this poem represents something two strangers, at least twenty years apart in age, shared in common so far in their lives. Now, I’ve never met the two players who both bend paper clips when they’re nervous and have both tangoed in a barn, but I can imagine them, meeting each other for the first time on the phone and realizing how many shared events had led up to this moment in their lives. In the end, the fun of the game is quite simple: the phone rings, and it’s a stranger, and just by chance you get to discover someone very different from you who has nevertheless lived a similarly fascinating life. Of course, the game can also be played with relatives and neighbors, and more than once, because it can produce thousands of unique interview sessions. When you start to realize how many interesting life experiences you might already share with someone from a completely different generation, there’s no limit to the number of connections you can make. And a game like Bounce makes it much easier to reach out to someone whose life might benefit greatly from knowing you better.\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "Even when the game ends, we may find ourselves participating more in these spaces, institutions, and activities than before. On the other hand, the communitas we feel may be just a short spark of social connection, nothing more. But even playing a very short game together, we are reminded of how much we share with even the strangest of strangers. We gain confidence that we can connect with others when we want to, and when we need to. And with that confidence, there is no reason to ever feel alone in the world—virtual, real, or otherwise\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "Practice random acts of kindness twice a week. (The reward center of the brain experiences a stronger “dopamine hit” when we make someone else smile than when we smile first.)\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "World Health Organization recently named depression the single most serious chronic threat to global health, beating out heart disease, asthma, and diabetes. 1\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "more than 50 percent of U.S. adults recently reported that they “lack great enthusiasm for life” and “don’t feel actively and productively engaged with the world.” 2\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "It turns out that knowing what makes us happy isn’t enough. We have to act on that knowledge, and not just once, but often. And it’s becoming increasingly obvious that it is just not that easy to put scientific findings into practice in our everyday lives. We need help implementing new happiness habits—and we can’t just help ourselves\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "Happiness activities sound “corny,”\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "happiness lives inside us, it’s turned us inward just when we should be looking outward . . . to other people, to community and to the kind of human bonds that so clearly are the sources of our happiness.” 7 Weiner makes an excellent point here: self-help isn’t typically social , but so many happiness activities are meant to be. Moreover, positive psychology has shown that for any activity to feel truly meaningful , it needs to be attached to a much bigger project or community\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "Ideally, happiness needs to be approached as a collective process. Happiness activities need to be done with friends, family, neighbors, strangers, coworkers, and all the other people who make up the social fabric of our lives.\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "Making the transition from theory to practice is difficult: changing deeply rooted habits of thinking, transforming ourselves and our world, requires a great deal of effort,” he writes. “People often abandon theories when they discover how difficult they are to put into practice.” 8 Either we never try or we get bored or frustrated quickly.\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "First, gamers are an extremely valuable—and largely untapped—source of participation bandwidth. Whoever figures out how to effectively engage them first for real work is going to reap enormous benefits. (And clearly, the Guardian’s Investigate Your MP’s Expenses represents one of the first organizations to do just that.)\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "the first organizations to do just that.) Second, crowdsourcing projects—if they have any hope of capturing enough participation bandwidth to achieve truly ambitious goals—must be intentionally designed to offer the same kinds of intrinsic rewards we get from good games\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "Why is Free Rice able to capture so much engagement? It isn’t just that it is a force for good; it’s also classically good game design. It takes just seconds to complete a task, meaning you can get a lot of work done quickly. You get instant visual feedback: grains of rice stacking up in a bowl, with a constantly rising total of grains that you’ve earned. Because the game gets easier when you make mistakes and harder when you answer correctly, it’s easy to experience flow: you’re always playing at the limits of your ability. And since the game was created, in 2007, its game world has expanded significantly: there’s a seemingly endless stream of potential tasks, with thirteen different subject areas, from famous paintings and world capitals to chemical symbols and French vocabulary. There’s also a clear sense that you’re a part of something bigger as you play. As the Free Rice site explains, “Though 10 grains of rice may seem like a small amount, it is important to remember that while you are playing, so are thousands of other people at the same time. It is everyone together that makes the difference.” So far, that difference is nothing less than epic: 69,024,128,710 grains of rice and counting—enough to provide more than 10 million meals worldwide.\\n\\nApril 24, 2015", "We don’t have an endless stream of opportunities to do something that matters right now , presented with clear instructions , and finely tuned to our moment-by-moment capabilities . Without that kind of creative and logistical support, there’s no easy way to go after epic goals and successfully achieve them in our everyday lives. Fortunately, a new genre of games called social participation games is trying to change that. They’re designed to give players real-world volunteer tasks that feel as heroic , as satisfying , and—most importantly—as readily achievable as MMORPG quests. And as a result, a growing number of gamers are getting their hands dirty doing real-world good—and improving and saving real lives\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "Compared with games, reality is unambitious. Games help us define awe-inspiring goals and tackle seemingly impossible social missions together\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "Social participation means using more than our minds: it requires throwing our hearts and our bodies into action. So the challenge that lies ahead is to design social participation tasks (SPTs) to stand alongside the growing number of human intelligence tasks (HITs) that currently make up the majority of online crowdsourcing projects: transcribing and subtitling videos on DotSUB, for example, analyzing an MP’s receipts in Investigate Your MP’s Expenses, or even simply evaluating an idea for a new product name as “good” or “bad.” What these efforts all have in common is that they appeal primarily to our cognitive, rather than our emotional and social, capabilities.\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "HITs are, without a doubt, important work, but we are more than just thinking machines. We are human beings capable of reaching out to others, feeling empathy, recognizing need, showing up, and making a difference in someone else’s life. We have social powers , and we can mobilize them for good—in real-world spaces, not just online spaces. All we need is the right kind of mission support\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "SOCIAL PARTICIPATION GAMES are innovating human potential. They are augmenting and expanding our capabilities to do good—and revealing our power to help each other, in the moment, wherever we are. The Extraordinaries is a perfect example of how epic wins can be integrated into our everyday lives, and how we can generate more participation bandwidth worldwide. But it’s not the only example—far from it. Let’s take a look at two more extraordinarily ambitious projects that are attempting to harness the social capacity of crowds: Groundcrew, a mobile people-organizing platform that allows you to make real-life wishes come true, and Lost Joules, an online energy conservation game that invites you to make virtual currency wagers on just how much social good other players can accomplish.\\n\\nApril 25, 2015", "June 13, 2017"]
