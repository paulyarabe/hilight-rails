As illustrated in Figure 1.2, voice lies at the nexus of talent (your natural gifts and strengths), passion (those things that naturally energize, excite, motivate and inspire you), need (including what the world needs enough to pay you for), and conscience (that still, small voice within that assures you of what is right and that prompts you to actually do it).\\n\\nAugust 18, 2018", "When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bounds. Your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction, and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. THE YOGA SUTRAS OF PATANJALI\\n\\nAugust 18, 2018", "I find that vision comes as people sense human need and respond to their conscience in trying to meet that need. And when they meet that need, they see another, and meet that, and on and on. Little by little, they begin to generalize this sense of need and start thinking of ways to institutionalize their efforts so they can be sustained. Muhammad Yunus is an example of a man who did exactly that—sensed human need and responded to conscience by applying his talent and passion to meet that need—first personally, then in building trust and searching for creative solutions to problems, and finally by institutionalizing the capacity to fill the needs of society through an organization. He found his voice in inspiring others to find theirs.\\n\\nAugust 18, 2018", "Few of us can do great things, but all of us can do small things with great love. MOTHER TERESA\\n\\nAugust 18, 2018", "Because many in positions of authority do not see the true worth and potential of their people and do not possess a complete, accurate understanding of human nature, they manage people as they do things. This lack of understanding also prevents them from tapping into the highest motivations, talents and genius of people. What happens when you treat people like things today? It insults and alienates them, depersonalizes work, and creates low-trust, unionized, litigious cultures.\\n\\nAugust 18, 2018", "people think that only those in positions of authority should decide what must be done. They have consented, perhaps unconsciously, to being controlled like a thing. Even if they perceive a need, they don’t take the initiative to act. They wait to be told what to do by the person with the formal title, and then they respond as directed. Consequently, they blame the formal leader when things go wrong and give him or her the credit when things go well.\\n\\nAugust 18, 2018", "The more a manager controls, the more he/she evokes behaviors that necessitate greater control or managing. The codependent culture that develops is eventually institutionalized to the point that no one takes responsibility. Over time, both leaders and followers confirm their roles in an unconscious pact. They disempower themselves by believing that others must change before their own circumstances can improve.\\n\\nAugust 18, 2018", "so many people have been raised being compared to others at home and competing against others in school, in athletics and in the workplace. These powerful influences cultivate a scarcity mentality, so that many people have a hard time being genuinely happy for the successes of others.\\n\\nAugust 21, 2018", "Author John Gardner once said, “Most ailing organizations have developed a functional blindness to their own defects. They are not suffering because they cannot resolve their problems, but because they cannot see their problems.” Einstein put it this way: “The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.”\\n\\nAugust 21, 2018", "If you want to make minor, incremental changes and improvements, work on practices, behavior or attitude. But if you want to make significant, quantum improvement, work on paradigms.\\n\\nAugust 22, 2018", "the power of an accurate paradigm. It explains, and then it guides.\\n\\nAugust 22, 2018", "four basic needs and motivations of all people illustrated in the film in the first chapter: to live (survival), to love (relationships), to learn (growth and development) and to leave a legacy (meaning and contribution)\\n\\nAugust 22, 2018", "rebel or quit, malicious obedience, willing compliance, cheerful cooperation, heartfelt commitment or creative excitement\\n\\nAugust 22, 2018", "But in today’s Information/Knowledge Worker Age, only one who is respected as a whole person in a whole job—one who is paid fairly, treated kindly, used creatively and given opportunities to serve human needs in principled ways (see figure 2.5)—makes one of the upper three choices of cheerful cooperation, heartfelt commitment or creative excitement\\n\\nAugust 21, 2018", "There is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come. VICTOR HUGO\\n\\nAugust 21, 2018", "Most of the great cultural shifts—ones that have built great organizations that sustain long-term growth, prosperity and contribution to the world—started with the choice of one person. Sometimes that one person was the formal leader—the CEO or president. Very often it started with someone else—a professional, a line manager, someone’s assistant. Regardless of their position, these people first changed themselves from the inside out. Their character, competence, initiative and positive energy—in short, their moral authority—inspired and lifted others. They possessed an anchored sense of identity, discovered their strengths and talents, and used them to meet needs and produce results. People noticed. They were given more responsibility. They magnified the new responsibility and again produced results. More and more people sat up and noticed.\\n\\nAugust 21, 2018", "Where does a person get such internal strength to swim against the current and to withstand negative cultural provocations, subordinate selfish interests and develop and sustain such vision and determination? They learn of their true nature and gifts. They use them to develop a vision of great things they want to accomplish. With wisdom they take initiative and cultivate great understanding of the needs and opportunities around them. They meet those needs that match their unique talents, that tap their higher motivations and that make a difference. In short, they find and use their voice.\\n\\nAugust 21, 2018", "They apply PRINCIPLES that govern growth and prosperity in human beings AND in organizations—principles that draw the highest and best from a “whole person”—body, mind, heart and spirit. Equally significant, they also choose to influence and inspire others to find their voice through these principles as well.\\n\\nAugust 21, 2018", "his father whispered into his ear, “Son, don’t do life like I did. I didn’t do right by you or by your mother and never really made a difference. Son, promise me you won’t do life like I did.”\\n\\nAugust 22, 2018", "Almost everyone acknowledges you learn best when you teach another and that your learning is internalized when you live it.\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "You will also find that sharing creates bonding with people—especially with your children. Have them regularly teach you what they are learning in school. My wife, Sandra, and I have found that doing this simple thing essentially eliminates any need for external motivation with their studies.\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be?\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "Your playing small doesn’t serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do.\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we’re liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "1. For the body—assume you’ve had a heart attack; now live accordingly. 2. For the mind—assume the half-life of your profession is two years; now prepare accordingly. 3. For the heart—assume everything you say about another, they can overhear; now speak accordingly. 4. For the spirit—assume you have a one-on-one visit with your Creator every quarter; now live accordingly.\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "The author, filmmaker and world-renowned storyteller Sir Laurens van der Post said, “Without vision we all suffer from an insufficiency of data. We look at life myopically, that is, through our own lens, our own world. Vision enables us to transcend our autobiography, our past to rise above our memory. This is particularly practical in human relationships and creates a magnanimity of spirit toward others.”\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "When we talk about vision, it’s important to consider not only the vision of what’s possible “out there” but also the vision of what we see in other people, their unseen potential. Vision is about more than just getting things done, accomplishing some task, achieving something; it is about discovering and expanding our view of others, affirming them, believing in them, and helping them discover and realize the potential within them—helping them find their own voice.\\n\\nAugust 23, 2018", "Cultivating the habit of affirming people, of frequently and sincerely communicating your belief in them—particularly teenagers who are going through their second identity crisis—is supremely important. It’s a relatively small investment with incalculable, unbelievable results.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2018", "Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. WARREN BENNIS\\n\\nAugust 25, 2018", "There’s a common misconception that a person’s skill is their talent. Skills, however, are not talents. Talents, on the other hand, require skills. People can have skills and knowledge in areas where their talents do not lie. If they have a job that requires their skills but not their talents, organizations will never tap into their passion or voice.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2018", "In everyone’s life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit. ALBERT SCHWEITZER\\n\\nAugust 25, 2018", "leadership is communicating to people their worth and potential so clearly that they come to see it in themselves.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2018", "The highest challenge inside organizations, including families, is to set them up and run them in a way that enables each person to inwardly sense his or her innate worth and potential for greatness and to contribute his or her unique talents and passion—in other words, voice—to accomplish the organization’s purpose and highest priorities in a principle-centered way.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2018", "let’s say that a person is unable to even keep the promises he makes to himself—his life is inconsistent, flaky and mood-based. Is there any way that he’d be able to develop healthy, trusting relationships with others? The answer is obvious.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2018", "it is vital to first pay the price of striving to find your voice personally before even attempting to develop the skills of building high-trust relationships and creative problem solving. The synergistic work of high-trust relationships then becomes the foundation for creating a team or organization of cooperative people—teams that are on the same page regarding purpose and values and are willing to play their role inside that context.\\n\\nAugust 26, 201"]
