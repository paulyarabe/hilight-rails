What do you want to know?” I thought about it for a few seconds. “I think the dog is cool,” I said, motioning toward Brownie, our five-year-old chocolate Lab mix. “What? What the hell does that mean? That’s not a fucking question.” “What if I said: Do people think the dog is cool?” “Jesus fucking Christ,” he said\\n\\nDecember 3, 2014", "I’m sorry I had to be so hard on you, but I don’t want people thinking you’re a lying sack of shit. You ain’t. You’re a quality human being. Now go to your room, you’re grounded.”\\n\\nDecember 3, 2014", "On Fair Play “Cheating’s not easy. You probably think it is, but it ain’t. I bet you’d suck more at cheating than whatever it was you were trying to do legitimately.”\\n\\nDecember 3, 2014", "You always have the right to be an asshole—you just shouldn’t use that right very often.”\\n\\nDecember 3, 2014", "Your penis betrayed you, son. Made you think stupid. It won’t be the last time that happens.”\\n\\nDecember 3, 2014", "Nobody likes practice, but what’s worse: practicing, or sucking at something?\\n\\nDecember 3, 2014", "But if you give a shit about what a bunch of people in Denny’s think about you, then the rest of what I was gonna say doesn’t even matter.” I told him to stop reading his newspaper, and he put it on the greasy table and looked me in the eye. “So is that why you took me here? Some kind of test to see if I’d get embarrassed?” “Son, do I look like the type with a master fucking plan? I just wanted to talk to you and eat some eggs. Let me finish doing one of them.”\\n\\nDecember 3, 2014", "On Remaining a Gentleman No Matter the Situation “I personally would never go to a prostitute, but if you’ve paid money for some strange, that doesn’t mean you can act like an idiot once you get it.”\\n\\nDecember 4, 2014", "This is complete fucking bullshit!” he screamed. At that point I left the living room and tried to hide in the hallway so I could still listen. “Out of your league?! What fucking league are you talking about?! You are a man, she is a fucking woman! That is all that matters, goddamn it!”\\n\\nDecember 4, 2014", "On Furnishing One’s Home “Pick your furniture like you pick a wife; it should make you feel comfortable and look nice, but not so nice that if someone walks past it they want to steal it.”\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "On Living on a Budget “Why are you going over your monthly expenses?…No, let me shorten this process for you: You make dog shit, so don’t spend any money.”\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "Even though he wouldn’t admit it, I always knew my dad was happy to see me when I came home. I’d usually head over at night, when he was home from work, and we’d have a nice chat about things that were going on in each other’s lives. It was the first time I had ever f\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "like I had an adult relationship with my dad. We were growing closer and becoming friends. I realized that we’d really broken down some barriers one evening in late June when he asked me to help him with a project in his garden that Friday. “Friday, come over at four. Don’t be late, I don’t want to be fucking with this after dark. I’ll buy you dinner afterwards,” he offered. Since he’d purchased the house in 1972, my dad’s garden had taken over almost every spare inch of our yards, front and back, and he’d planted not only flowers but tomatoes, lettuce, even corn. He loved his garden and spent most of his free time taking meticulous care of it. He was also very particular about who touched it. That Friday he was going to put up some fencing to grow tomatoes, a difficult job for one guy. He normally did the tough jobs on his own anyway. One time many years earlier I had\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "on his garden that coming Friday, the request meant a lot to me. He didn’t need my help—he wanted it. On Thursday, the night before I was supposed to help him out, I was studying with a girl named Stacy from my communications class. We were taking a summer school course because each of us had dropped a class during the school year. I had been in a few classes with Stacy before and had developed a major crush on her. I had never asked her out or even hinted at my feelings, mostly because she had a boyfriend, but even if she hadn’t, I doubt I would have gotten up the courage to make a move.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "You little shit,” he said. “I can’t wait till you have some kid and you got to worry about what happens to him. You never stop worrying about your children. It sucks. You watch what you stick your dick into, because this is your life, this bullshit right here.” He released me from the hug and grabbed a plastic grocery bag filled with chips. “Grab that bottle of ketchup, we’re late for the barbecue your uncle is throwing.” “I was going to meet Dan at the beach, actually,” I said tentatively, hoping he would respect my Fourth of July plans. “Shut the fuck up and grab the bag. You got some balls\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "From now on, when I ask you how you’re doing, I appreciate you being open, but don’t tell me stories about you jerking off to your gay neighbors,” he said, laughing. “Listen, you’ve only been up there a month. This shit takes time. Steven Spielberg didn’t become Steven Spielberg in a month. He was probably just some asshole who’s a l\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "My parents wanted me to feel good about myself, and they knew that I wasn’t going to have a shot at being successful unless I did. I wasn’t Charles Bukowski; my misery was not going to translate to literary genius and royalty checks. My dad ended the phone call with one emphatic sentence. “I’m taking you to Lawry’s Prime Beef!” Lawry’s is mostly known for its seasoned salt, which you can purchase in almost any large grocery store, but they also have a famous steak house, Lawry’s The Prime Rib Restaurant, in Los Angeles, which my dad loves\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "“To you guys. For sticking your asses out on the line and going after it. And to Justin for getting a new job.” I never would have thought a person could so energetically toast a job that paid minimum wage, but my dad’s pride was completely genuine.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "as a waiter for five of them—I can tell you that we operate the same way a stripper does: Give us money, and we’ll pretend we like you. After our waitress saw the tip, she sashayed back to the table and began chatting us up even more. When my dad found out she was single, he pointed at me and said, “That one is single, too. He lives up here now. You two should get together.” (Because if there’s any indication that two people should begin having sexual intercourse, it’s that they live in the same city)\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "That’s a big deal to me. You may not think things you do mean shit, but remember that they mean shit to me, okay?” “I know.” “Yeah, you know everything. That’s why you jerked off to your gay neighbors.” “Dad, we’re right in front of their apartment.” He laughed, then gave me another hug. “You always got us. We’re family. We ain’t going anywhere. Unless you go on a fucking killing spree or something.” “I would still love you, Justy. I would just want to know why you did it,” my mom said earnestly, having gotten back into the car and rolled down her window.\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "June 13, 2017", "Sometimes life leaves a hundred-dollar bill on your dresser, and you don’t realize until later it’s because it fucked you.”\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014", "People are always trying to tell you how they feel. Some of them say it outright, and some of them, they tell you with their actions. And you have to listen. I don’t know what will happen with your lady friend. I think she’s a nice person, and I hope you get what you want. But do me a favor: Listen, and don’t ignore what you hear.”\\n\\nDecember 5, 2014"]
