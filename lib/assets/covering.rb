book_notes = ["In a supposedly enlightened age, the persistence of the covering demand presents a puzzle. Today, race, national origin, sex, religion, and disability are all protected by federal civil rights laws. An increasing number of states and localities include sexual orientation in civil rights laws as well. Albeit with varying degrees of conviction, Americans have come to a consensus that people should not be penalized for being different along these dimensions. That consensus, however, does not protect individuals against demands that they mute those differences. We need an explanation for why the civil rights revolution has stalled on covering. Covering has enjoyed such a robust and stubborn life because it is a form of assimilation\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "Covering is a hidden assault on our civil rights. We have not been able to see it as such because it has swaddled itself in the benign language of assimilation. But if we look closely, we will see that covering is the way many groups are being held back today. The reason racial minorities are pressured to “act white” is because of white supremacy. The reason women are told to downplay their child-care responsibilities in the workplace is because of patriarchy. And the reason gays are asked not to “flaunt” is because of homophobia. So long as such covering demands persist, American civil rights will not have completed its work.\\n\\nApril 2, 2015", "Unfortunately, the law has yet to perceive covering as a threat. Contemporary civil rights law generally only protects traits that individuals cannot change, like their skin color, chromosomes, or innate sexual orientations. This means that current law will not protect us against most covering demands, because such demands direct themselves at the behavioral aspects of our personhood. This is so despite the fact that covering imposes costs on us all.\\n\\nApril 2, 2015", "Because covering applies to us all, it provides an issue around which we can make common cause. This is the desire for authenticity, our common human wish to express ourselves without being impeded by unreasoning demands for conformity\\n\\nApril 2, 2015", "After discussing passing, Goffman observes that “persons who are ready to admit possession of a stigma … may nonetheless make a great effort to keep the stigma from looming large.” He calls this behavior “covering.” Goffman distinguishes passing from covering by noting that passing pertains to the visibility of a particular trait, while covering pertains to its obtrusiveness . He relates how Franklin Roosevelt always stationed himself behind a table before his advisers came in for meetings. Roosevelt was not passing, since everyone knew he used a wheelchair. He was covering, downplaying his disability so people would focus on his more conventionally presidential qualities\\n\\nApril 2, 2015", "The day I won the Rhodes was a proud one in my father’s life—the ultimate proof his son had made it in America. And who could blame him? Assimilation is the magic in the American dream\\n\\nApril 2, 2015", "In the old generation, discrimination targeted entire groups—no racial minorities, no women, no gays, no religious minorities, no people with disabilities allowed. In the new generation, discrimination directs itself not against the entire group, but against the subset of the group that fails to assimilate to mainstream norms. This new form of discrimination targets minority cultures rather than minority persons.\\n\\nApril 2, 2015", "I had learned the language of power; it was now time to wield it. To my chagrin, I found our major civil rights laws—such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equality guarantees of the federal Constitution—do not currently provide much protection against covering demands. Courts have often interpreted these laws to protect statuses but not behaviors, being but not doing . For this reason, courts will often not protect individuals against covering demands, which target the behavioral aspects of identity—speaking a language, having a child, holding a same-sex commitment ceremony, wearing religious garb, or refusing to “correct” a disability.\\n\\nApril 2, 2015", "American equality law must be reformed to protect individuals against covering demands. Yet our generation of civil rights will also increasingly need to look outside the law. Many covering demands occur at such an intimate and daily level that they are not susceptible to legal correction. Such demands are better redressed through appeals to our individual faculties of conscience and compassion. When my colleagues suggested I stop writing on gay topics, my best response was not a lawsuit but a conversation. Law is also an inadequate remedy because the covering demand extends beyond traditional civil rights groups.\\n\\nApril 5, 2015", "After all, the questioner says, I have to cover all the time. I have to mute my depression, or my obesity, or my alcoholism, or my schizophrenia, or my shyness, or my working-class background, or my nameless anomie. I, too, am one of the mass of men leading a life of quiet desperation. Why should classic civil rights groups have a right to self-expression I do not? Why should my struggle for an authentic self matter less? I surprise these individuals when I agree. Contemporary civil rights has erred in focusing solely on traditional civil rights groups, such as racial minorities, women, gays, religious minorities, and individuals with disabilities. This assumes those in the so-called mainstream—those straight white men—do not have covered selves. They are understood only as impediments, as people who prevent others from expressing themselves, rather than as individuals who are themselves struggling for self-definition.\\n\\nApril 5, 2015", "it is not normal to be completely normal. All of us struggle for self-expression; we all have covered selves. For this reason, we should understand civil rights to be a sliver of a universal project of human flourishing. Civil rights has always sought to protect the human flourishing of certain groups from being\\n\\nApril 5, 2015", "thwarted by the irrational beliefs of others. Yet that aspiration is one we should hold for all humanity.\\n\\nApril 5, 2015", "Law’s inability to apprehend our full human complexity, however, means our culture must do that work.\\n\\nApril 5, 2015", "new civil rights requires both legal and cultural action. My first passion was literature, which I left from the belief that “ poetry makes nothing happen.” Now I see Auden meant those words ironically, and find myself revisiting my old belief. Law wields a brutal coercion literature cannot approximate. Yet literature has a power to get inside us, to transform our hearts and minds, in a way law cannot. This book uses both languages, relying not only on legal arguments but on literary narrative—the stories of people, including me, who struggled against demands for conformity. In telling these stories, I do not argue categorically against assimilation. Such an argument would be rash, for assimilation is often a precondition of civilization—to speak a language, to curb violent urges, and to obey the law are all acts of assimilation. Through such acts we rise above the narrow stations of our lives to enter into a broader mindfulness, and often, paradoxically, we\\n\\nApril 5, 2015", "must do this to elaborate ourselves as individuals. I argue here only against coerced assimilation not supported by reasons—against a reflexive conformity that takes itself as its own rationale\\n\\nApril 5, 2015", "We all have a story we must repeat until we get it right, a story whose conveniences must be corrected and whose simplifications must be seen through before we are done with it, or it with us. For gay people, that story is often the story of how we came out. There are times when I feel like the Mariner, wondering how many more times I will have to tell my tale.\\n\\nApril 16, 2015", "At the end of my first term at Oxford, my father came to visit. I had not told him I was gay, nor that I was in love with Brian. I had only said I was having a quarter-life crisis, that I didn’t know what I wanted to be. But he heard the grief in my voice.\\n\\nApril 16, 2015", "“I’m sorry, Papa,” I finally said. “I can’t do anything. I’ve failed. I have nothing.” Then I paused. Could I say it? I could not. Something dull spoke instead: “I am nothing.” I felt him before I heard him. It was not his usual brisk embrace, but as if, in the warm parentheses of his arms, he had made me part of him. He said: “You are my son.” And I began to sob. Perhaps this is the worst any closet does to us—it prevents us from hearing the words “I love you.” These were words my parents said to me, and I trusted the love, but not the “you.” The real me was hidden, so the “you” they loved was some other, better son. But when my father claimed me— This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine —I began to suspect that no matter what I was, he would be next to me, the silent economist stroking my hair\\n\\nApril 16, 2015", "“But if this is so,” my mother said in Japanese, “we will never be able to go back to Japan.” I realized then what I had feared about coming out to my parents. That someone—myself, my mother, my father—would die. Would curl up, turn face to the wall, and expire. When my mother spoke those words, I knew she was telling me of a death—a metaphorical death, a social death, but a death. That was the albatross I killed—her cross-shaped innocence, her idea of home.\\n\\nApril 16, 2015", "April 17, 2015", "I believe it logically and morally follows there is a right to say what one is . When the military says it is not against homosexuality but only against avowed homosexuality, I sense an inconsistency that calls the first part of the claim into question. For this reason, the First Amendment should protect individuals for self-identifying as gay. The Supreme Court has not yet pronounced on this right, but the highest court to speak on this issue has rejected its existence. In 1984, a federal court of appeals confronted a case in which a guidance counselor, Marjorie Rowland, had been terminated by a public school for coming out as bisexual. Under controlling precedents, the court had to balance her interest in speaking on an issue of “public concern” against the school’s interest in promoting efficient service. The court found Rowland’s “coming out” speech failed to rise to the level of “public concern,” as she was speaking “only in her personal interest.” The court upheld Rowland’s dismissal. More recently, a lower court in a different jurisdiction disagreed with the Rowland court’s contention that coming out was a private matter, sensibly observing that if so many individuals cared about a gay employee’s revelation, her speech was of public concern. As courts reach different results, it becomes more likely the Supreme Court will step in to resolve the inconsistency. When it does, it should consider Justice William Brennan’s comment on the Rowland decision. Dissenting from the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear that case, the Court’s great liberal said Rowland’s coming-out speech should be protected because her speech was “no more than a natural consequence of her sexual orientation,” insofar as it was “realistically impossible to separate her spoken statements from her status.”\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "When I teach “Sexual Orientation and the Law,” some students ask if I will change the name of the class on their transcript, so employers won’t think they are gay. I refuse, saying this would be an implied apology on our part. I ask them if they want to be employed by someone who would discriminate against them on this basis. But I also tell them they can wait, and take the class when they are ready, and that I am here in the interim.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "The real revelation, however, has been understanding the other closets my students inhabit. To be a teacher, at least of the subjects I teach, is to know the coming-out story is universal.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "Or we wake, and I make him breakfast because I feel guilty about not taking him to a party to which partners are invited. After I realize our fights almost always concern the outside world, I voice my wish we could live sequestered, have the food shipped in. He says I wish for a closet built for two. This angers me. By this time, I have come out to my parents, my friends, my classmates, my professors. I am also just as activist as Paul in some ways, like making gay rights my work. Yet I know what he means. Paul is more radically queer than I. He grew up in San Francisco and came out at fifteen, and now experiences anything short of full-flaunting equality as self hatred. I puzzle over how much we fight about how to perform our gayness, even though we are both openly gay. Although I do not realize it then, we are having the debate of the gay moment—the debate between normals and queers over covering.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "If conversion divides ex-gays from gays, and passing divides closeted gays from out gays, covering divides normals from queers . This last divide travels in many guises—as one between assimilationists and liberationists, or conservatives and sex radicals. Whatever we call it, it is the major fault line in the gay community today\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "By queers , I mean gays who emphasize their difference from the mainstream. Michael Warner, a professor of English at Rutgers, can stand for this position—his 1999 book, The Trouble with Normal , is the queer answer to Sullivan’s Virtually Normal . Warner exhorts queers to resist the normalization of the gay rights movement: “People who are defined by a variant set of norms commit a kind of social suicide when they begin to measure the worth of their relations and their way of life by the yardstick of normalcy.” For this reason, Warner believes queers should “insist that the dominant culture assimilate to queer culture, not the other way around.” His sentiment is captured in the slogan “We’re here, we’re queer, get used to it,” which not only gives difference a local habitation and a name (“We’re here, we’re queer”) but also commands nonqueers rather than queers to accommodate that difference (“Get used to it”).\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "This suggests gays can cover along many axes. I believe there are four. Appearance concerns how an individual physically presents herself to the world. Affiliation concerns her cultural identifications. Activism concerns how much she politicizes her identity. Association concerns her choice of fellow travelers—lovers, friends, colleagues. These are the dimensions along which gays decide just how gay we want to be. Here my argument assumes a truly general form. Unlike conversion and passing, covering is a strategy of assimilation available to all groups, including but not limited to the classic civil rights groups of racial minorities, women, religious minorities,\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "Like many covering demands, this voice was internal—no colleague ever imposed it on me. I came to distrust it. I have a nurturing quality or two, and value them in myself. To withhold them from my students to rebut a stereotype seemed self-defeating, even unethical.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "The selective uptake of gay culture—gay fashion, yes; gay affection, no—shows that acceptance is driven by the desires of the straight cultural consumer rather than the dignity of the gay person.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "Millions of gay people live their lives without making it their cause. Why must you make it yours?”\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "Yet the answer I want to give—that I have always had a commitment to social justice—also seems wrong. Growing up, I was more interested in aesthetics than in politics. Even when I went to law school, I did so to protect myself, not others.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "My mother’s voice is suddenly heavy with grief. “If you speak so loudly, our world becomes very small\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "As it stood, it was all too easy to privilege my career over our relationship. The career was prestigious, a source of public esteem. The relationship was stigmatized, and mostly a secret.  I had not introduced Paul to my friends in law school, or to my parents.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "He wasn’t oblivious to the looks of strangers, but could ignore them more easily than I. When we took walks up Whitney Avenue, his hand would reach for mine in an unconscious radiation of affection, making me feel small-souled for wanting to reject it. And yet I usually did. I wince remembering one particular refusal. Paul and I had gone to the hospital to get a diagnosis for him that could have been serious. In the waiting room, his right leg was going like a jackhammer. He reached for my hand, and I brushed it away. What does it matter? I would say to myself. He knows I care about him—in our apartments, in our private places, I show him. Yet I have come to see this differently. In saying I was gay, I showed I was willing to value myself over the world’s opinion. In reaching for my hand, Paul was asking me to give him the same priority.\\n\\nApril 17, 2015", "religious minorities must downplay their faith because of religious intolerance, and the disabled must mute their disabilities because of a culture that fetishizes the able-bodied. If civil rights law fails to protect these groups against coerced conformity, it will have stopped short of its end.\\n\\nApril 27, 2015", "We should not slide to the bottom of the slippery slope, where outsider groups would always win their cases. But we should require what I will call a reason-forcing conversation , making the state or the employer justify burdens placed on a protected group. The state or employer can demand conformity so long as it backs the demand with a reason rather than a bias. Far from fostering a culture of complaint, this paradigm encourages a culture of greater rationality. Rationality should replace immutability as the wall across the slippery slope\\n\\nApril 27, 2015", "April 27, 2015", "This psychological discourse about authentic selves sounds distant from current civil rights discourse. We must close that gap. The new civil rights must harness this universal impulse toward authenticity. That impulse should press us toward thinking of civil rights less in terms of groups than in terms of our common humanity\\n\\nApril 27, 2015", "Similarly, Malcolm X exhorted Americans to “expand the civil-rights struggle to the level of human rights,” so that the “jurisdiction of Uncle Sam” would not prevent us from allying with our “brothers” of other nations.\\n\\nApril 27, 2015", "April 27, 2015", "The aspiration of civil rights has always been to permit people to pursue their human flourishing without limitations based on bias. Focusing on law prevents us from seeing the revolutionary breadth of that aspiration, as law has limited civil rights to particular groups. I am not faulting that limitation, as I think prioritization is necessary, and that the law’s priorities are correct. But civil rights, which has always extended far beyond the law, may now need to do so more than ever. It is only when we leave the law that civil rights suddenly stops being about particular groups and starts to become a project of human flourishing in which we all have a stake. We must use the relative freedom of adulthood to integrate the many selves we hold. This includes uncovering the selves we buried long ago\\n\\nApril 27, 2015", "April 27, 2015", "April 27, 2015"]
