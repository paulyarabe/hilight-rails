Like sculpting raw clay into a beautiful statue, over time their story becomes more and more compelling. Finally they decide that it is time to act on it, to bring it into the light and test it against reality.

Susceptibility depends on several factors, including whether the role model is sufficiently similar to the new person that the new behavior is likely to be useful; that the level of trust between the role model and the new person is high; and the consistency between the new idea and previously learned behaviors. As a result, the flow of ideas can sometimes be quite slow, rather different from the viral marketing that advertising agencies like to talk about.\\n\\nDecember 8, 2015", "star producers engage in “preparatory exploration”; that is, they develop dependable two-way streets to experts ahead of time, setting up a relationship that will later help the star producer complete critical tasks. Moreover, the stars’ networks differed from typical workers’ networks in two important respects. First, they maintained stronger engagement with the people in their networks, so that these people responded more quickly and helpfully. As a result, the stars rarely spent time spinning their wheels or going down blind alleys.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "Stars, on the other hand, had people in their networks with a more diverse set of work roles, so they could adopt the perspectives of customers, competitors, and managers. Because they could see the situation from a variety of viewpoints, they could develop better solutions to problems.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "when people see others adopting strategies similar to their own, they often become more confident, and they are then likely to increase their investment in that particular strategy. People’s decisions are a blend of personal information and social information, and when the personal information is weak, they will tend to rely more on social information. In a situation where people are uncertain, the confidence-enhancing effect of social learning becomes larger. This makes perfect sense: When people don’t know what is going on, they can learn by spending more time looking at what others are doing. Unfortunately, this can also lead to overconfidence and groupthink, because the mechanism of social learning only improves decision making when people have different individual information.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "Because idea flow takes into account the variables of a social network structure, the strength of social influence between people, and individual susceptibilities to new ideas, it also serves another vital role: It gives a reliable prediction of how changing any of these variables will change the performance of all the people in the network. Thus, this mathematically derived concept of idea flow allows us to “tune” social networks in order to make better decisions and achieve better results.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "December 9, 2015", "Engagement with and learning from others, along with the mutual sharing and vetting of ideas, generate the collective intelligence.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "Idea flow depends upon social learning, and indeed, this is why social physics works: Our behavior can be predicted from our exposure to the example behaviors of other people.

In the Social Evolution Study, led by PhD student Anmol Madan and myself, with Professor David Lazer helping with design of the experiment and data analysis, we gave all the participating students smartphones with special software so that we could track their social interactions with both close friends and acquaintances.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "What we found was that weight change showed a very strong association with exposure to peers who gained weight but not to those who lost weight. And further, social interaction with close friends who experienced a weight change showed no significant effect at all. A similar effect was also found when we examined eating habits, with exposure to peers being the key variable.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "In other words, exposure to overheard comments or casual observation of other people’s behavior can drive idea flow just as well as, and in some cases better than, more direct interactions such as conversations, telephone calls, and social media. Idea flow sometimes depends more on seeing what people actually do than on hearing what they say they do\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "December 9, 2015", "Therefore, people seem to pick up at least some habits from exposure to those of peers (and not just friends). When everyone else takes that second slice of pizza, we probably will also. The fact that exposure turned out to be more important for driving idea flow than all the other factors combined highlights the overarching importance of automatic social learning in shaping our lives.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "The question we asked was: Do political views reflect the behaviors that people are exposed to or are they formed more by individual reasoning?\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "When sifting through these hundreds of gigabytes of data, we found that the amount of exposure to people possessing similar opinions accurately predicted both the students’ level of interest in the presidential race and their liberal-conservative balance.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "Most important, though, this meant that the amount of exposure to people with similar views also predicted the students’ eventual voting behavior. For first-year students, the size of this social exposure effect was similar to the weight gain ones I described in the previous section, while for older students, who presumably had more fixed attitudes, the size of the effect was less but still quite significant. But what did not predict their voting behavior? The views of the people they talked politics with, and the views of their friends. Just as with weight gain, it was the behavior of the surrounding peer group—the set of behavior examples that they were immersed in—that was the most powerful force in driving idea flow and shaping opinion...Overheard comments and the observation of other people’s behavior are effective drivers of idea flow\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "As Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman might have put it, we can consciously reason about which flow of ideas we want to swim in, but then exposure to those ideas will work to shape our habits and beliefs subconsciously.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "The app and music cases are different from the health habits or political preferences, however. In both cases we could make good predictions about what people sampled but not what they would actually use or purchase. The effect of social exposure was informational, guiding their search for new apps or new music, but not normative. In other words, the particular app or music sampled often did not turn into a habit.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "Perhaps this is because learning from surrounding example behaviors is much more efficient than learning solely from our own experiences. Mathematical models of learning in complex environments suggest that the best strategy for learning is to spend 90 percent of our efforts on exploration, i.e., finding and copying others who appear to be doing well. 15 The remaining 10 percent should be spent on individual experimentation and thinking things through.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "As the work of Stanley Milgram on social conformity demonstrated, when our peers are all doing the same thing, be it gaining or losing weight, or even doing something outrageous such as doling out electric shocks, the uniformity of the example behaviors around us strongly influences both unconscious habits and conscious decisions.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "Psychological studies have shown that the snap judgments of people are more altruistic and cooperative than the decisions made slowly and thoughtfully.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "Multiple exposures showing that a new behavior has a good outcome (such as social approval) are needed before we are likely to pick up the habit as our own.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "December 9, 2015", "These data tell us that what we want and value, as well as how we choose to act in order to obtain our desires, are a constantly evolving property of interactions with other people.

As we reported in the Nature journal Scientific Reports , PhD student Ankur Mani, visiting Masdar faculty member Iyad Rahwan, and I have been able work out mathematically how best to motivate people by using social network incentives to increase their cooperation. 12 These incentives alter idea flow by creating social pressure, increasing the amount of interaction around specific, targeted ideas, and thus increasing the likelihood that people will incorporate those ideas into their behavior.\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "December 9, 2015", "In fact, if anyone got three or more invitations to join the network within a half hour, and if those invitations were from people who were already engaged with\\n\\nDecember 9, 2015", "them and their work group, then they were almost certain to join and give the digital social network a try.

And because workers are not engaged with management, neither has the opportunity to learn from the other, and so business processes remain rigid and inefficient. In contrast, in Wikipedia’s organization, continual exchanges between contributors and editors led to the development of interaction patterns that evolved to meet the needs of this rapidly growing enterprise. Peer pressure around these habits of interaction produced coordinated activity in a very efficient, effective manner.\\n\\nJanuary 5, 2016", "For most people, the primary pattern is the workday, that is, going to work and coming home, usually along the same path day after day. The second most pronounced pattern is the weekend and days off, often with the characteristic behavior of sleeping in and spending that night out in a location besides home or work. Perhaps surprisingly, the places we go and things we do during our free time are almost as regular as our work patterns. The third pattern, however, is a wild card: days spent exploring, usually a shopping trip or an outing. This last is distinguished by its lack of structure. Together these three patterns typically account for 90 percent or more of our behavior.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2016", "Perhaps the most interesting idea is to use transportation networks to increase the productivity and creative output of cities: We can use data about people’s habits to structure public transportation to promote more exploration within a city. It has long been observed that physically isolated neighborhoods have worse social outcomes. 6 This is linked to the concept developed in Chapter 2 , in which exploration among groups improves both productivity and creative output. On the scale of cities, it suggests that the number of different neighborhoods that can be visited conveniently sets the pace of exploration and thus the pace of innovation and productivity growth. Designing a city for fast, flat-rate transportation that promotes both village-style neighborhoods and central big business and cultural areas may be the simplest and cheapest way to both improve poor neighborhoods and increase overall productivity, as I will discuss in the next chapter.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2016", "Tuning the social network: A second type of intervention involves tuning the network to provide sufficient idea diversity. In Chapter 2 I showed that people made much better decisions when they could see those of a wide range of other people, and their outcomes. The exception to this wisdom of the crowd phenomenon was when the social network was so dense that it formed a sort of echo chamber, so that the same ideas circulated around and around.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "To solve the problems of both insufficient diversity and echo chambers, we were able to tune the flows of ideas between people by providing small incentives, or nudges, to individuals. These caused isolated people to engage more with others, and caused people who were too interconnected to engage less and to explore outside their current contacts.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "the pattern of links between ideas, reactions, and further suggestions provides an accurate picture of the networks along which ideas are propagated.

The social pressure this created caused electricity consumption to drop almost 17 percent—twice the improvement seen in earlier energy conservation campaigns.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "A larger percentage of people now live in cities than at any other point in human history...It may be that Adam Smith called it correctly: Urban centers are exceptional not only for depravity but also for innovation. 3 Despite more than a century of intense study of cities, we still lack a compelling model for why urban areas tend to promote innovation. And innovate, they do. Urban areas use resources more efficiently and produce more patents and inventions with fewer roads and services per capita than rural areas.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "our closer social ties support engagement, because those people are more likely to talk to each other and provide the reinforcement that transforms ideas into behaviors. Likewise, our distant social ties serve the role of exploration, because we meet new people in new contexts and harvest new ideas from them.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "January 8, 2016", "stores, restaurants, and entertainment places that you visit most are also likely to be visited by your friends, and so are unlikely to contribute new ideas to you or your social network. The greatest chance of an experience that is new to everyone in your social network comes from the places you visit least frequently.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "Consequently, the importance of packing people physically close to each other is still critical to promoting greater idea flow. 28 Easy face-to-face access between individuals enhances exploration, engagement, and the rate at which new ideas are converted into behaviors. Thus, physical proximity remains perhaps the major factor in productivity and creative output.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "January 8, 2016", "Digital media don’t convey social signals as well as face-to-face interactions, making it harder for people to read each other, and so digital media are less useful in generating the trust needed for behavior change. In so-called trust experiments, which set one’s potential profit by cooperating and trusting others in a group against the possibility of individually profiting from defecting from the group, we find that people who are interacting over digital media almost always defect. Similarly, when we look at communication channels versus moods, we find that on days when people are either in a really bad mood or a really good mood, they shun e-mail, messaging, and social media, and instead turn more to face-to-face interactions and telephone calls. When we need comfort or are especially happy, we want rich channels of interactions. In addition, most digital social media are sporadic, asynchronous, and sparse. As we saw in the digital engagement section of Chapter 4 , this means that it is difficult to get repeated, frequent exposure to the behavior of trusted peers. As a result, most digital social media are better at spreading facts (and rumors) than spreading new habits. Where it gets complicated is that once a social norm is in place—probably learned through face-to-face interactions—then electronic reminders can be quite effective. For instance, it is real-world interactions that drive most electronic interactions but once begun, electronic media can reinforce a trusted relationship, even though the people remain physically separated\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2016", "June 13, 2017", "Private organizations collect the vast majority of personal data in the form of location patterns, financial transactions, phone and Internet communications, and so on.
