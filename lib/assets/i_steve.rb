The feedback we’ve got has been off the charts. We think this is a profound game-changer. We think when people look back some number of years from now, they’ll see this as a major event in personal computation devices. What’s been really great for me is how quickly people have got it. You know, I’ve gotten a few thousand emails from people I’ve never talked to before just telling me how much they think this product is going to change their life and what they do. People are getting it very quickly.\\n\\nJune 13, 2017", "All we are is our ideas, or people. That’s what keeps us going to work in the morning, to hang around these great bright people. I’ve always thought that recruiting is the heart and soul of what we do.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "We’re not going to be the first to this party, but we’re going to be the best.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "It’s not just recruiting. After recruiting, it’s building an environment that makes people feel they are surrounded by equally talented people and their work is bigger than they are. The feeling that the work will have tremendous influence and is part of a strong, clear vision—all those things.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "We don’t stand a chance of advertising with features and benefits and with RAMs and with charts and comparisons. The only chance we have of communicating is with a feeling.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "When you first start off trying to solve a problem, the first solutions you come up with are very complex, and most people stop there. But if you keep going, and live with the problem and peel more layers of the onion off, you can oftentimes arrive at some very elegant and simple solutions. Most people just don’t put in the time or energy to get there. We believe that customers are smart and want objects which are well thought through.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "Real artists ship.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me.… Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful—that’s what matters to me.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "To design something really well, you have to get it.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "People judge you by your performance, so focus on the outcome. Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "Focus People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "You need a very product-oriented culture, even in a technology company.\\n\\nJanuary 7, 2015", "“Because I’m the CEO and I think it can be done.” And so they kind of begrudgingly did it. But then it was a big hit\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "January 8, 2015", "If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "Let’s go invent tomorrow rather than worrying about what happened yesterday.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "So you have to listen very carefully. But then you have to go and sort of stow away—you have to go hide away with people that really understand the technology, but also really care about the customers, and dream up this next breakthrough. And that’s my perspective, that everything starts with a great product. And that has its flaws\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "I think the artistry is in having an insight into what one sees around them. Generally putting things together in a way no one else has before and finding a way to express that to other people who don’t have that insight…\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "The most important thing is a person . A person who incites and feeds your curiosity; and machines cannot do that in the same way that people can.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "My dream is that every person in the world will have their own Apple computer. To do that, we’ve got to be a great marketing company.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "Innovation has nothing to do with how many R\\u0026D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R\\u0026D. It’s not about money. It’s about the people you have, how you’re led,\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "you really look at the ones that ended up being “successful” in the eyes of the society and the ones that didn’t, oftentimes it’s the ones [who] were successful loved what they did, so they could persevere when it got really tough. And the ones that didn’t love it quit because they’re sane, right?\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "the only way to do great work is to love what you do.… Don’t settle\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "I’m convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.… Unless you have a lot of passion about this, you’re not going to survive. You’re going to give it up. So you’ve got to have an idea, or a problem or a wrong that you want to right that you’re passionate about; otherwise, you’re not going to have the perseverance to stick it through.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "When we create stuff, we do it because we listen to customers, get their inputs and also throw in what we’d like to see, too. We cook up new products. You never really know if people will love them as much as you do.\\n\\nJanuary 8, 2015", "I feel like somebody just punched me in the stomach and knocked all my wind out. I’m only 30 years old and I want to have a chance to continue creating things. I know I’ve got at least one more great computer in me. And Apple is not going to give me a chance to do that.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "My model for business is the Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other’s kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. That’s how I see business: great things in business are never done by one person, they’re done by a team of people.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "[Technology] doesn’t change the world. It really doesn’t. Technologies can make it easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. But it’s a disservice to constantly put things in a radical new light, that it’s going to change everything. Things don’t have to change the world to be important.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "how do you tell somebody what you are, who you are, what you care about? And the best way we could think of was, you know, if you know who somebody’s heroes are, that tells you a lot about them.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "Once you get into the problem…you see that it’s complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That’s where most people stop, and the solutions tend to work for a while. But the really great person will keep going, find the underlying problem, and come up with an elegant solution that works on every level.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown our your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "How easy is this going to be for the user? How great it is going to be for the user?”\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "Zen Buddhism: It places value on experience versus intellectual understanding. I saw a lot of people contemplating things but it didn’t seem to lead to too many places. I got very interested in people who had discovered something more significant than an intellectual, abstract understanding.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "We’re gambling on our vision, and we would rather do that than make “me, too” products. Let some other companies do that. For us, it’s always the next dream.\\n\\nJanuary 9, 2015", "Bill Gates said about six months ago. He said, “I worked really, really hard in my twenties.” And I know what he means, because I worked really, really hard in my twenties, too—seven days a week, lots of hours every day.
