book_notes = ["Nature gets the heart right 99 percent of the time.9 That sounds pretty great until you realize that in the United States, the 1 percent of children born with congenital heart defects amounts to forty thousand babies a year.10\\n\\nAugust 3, 2019", "Blowing a balloon open in a diseased valve was a Band-Aid at best. Cribier’s eventual goal was much loftier: he wanted to transform aortic valve replacement from open-heart surgery to a minimally invasive procedure by “implanting a valve prosthesis within the diseased calcific native valve, on the beating heart, using catheter-based techniques and local anesthesia.” He faced extensive challenges to be able to even imagine what this might look like, but the biggest one had nothing to do with science and technology. “The negative opinion of experts was definitely the greatest barrier,” he wrote to me. “The idea was even considered the most stupid idea ever heard.”\\n\\nAugust 4, 2019", "For most of modern times, the discovery and initial description of angina was attributed to British physician William Heberden (1710–1801), in his very vaguely titled paper, “Some Account of Disorder of the Breast,” which he presented to the Royal College of Physicians in London in 1768; it was published in 1772.8 Heberden provided an arresting and incredibly accurate description based off an analysis of only twenty patients: “Those who are afflicted with it, are seized while they are walking with a painful and most disagreeable sensation in the breast, which seems as if it would extinguish life if it were to increase.”\\n\\nAugust 5, 2019", "These breathtaking discoveries, these complex descriptions of heart disease, in all their different forms, though, would remain unknown for centuries. While much of Western medicine draws a straight line back to the Egyptians, in many ways, much of what was learned in the cradle of human civilization was lost, and many of these conditions, such as angina or heart failure, would not be “discovered” until centuries after they had already been recognized. It was our inability to comprehend their ancient language that prevented these findings from being transmitted and built upon rather than buried underneath the ruins of time.\\n\\nAugust 5, 2019", "Harvey, who was incredibly powerful at the time of the publication of his work, knew that he was not immune to retribution. In De Motu Cordis, he wrote, “What remains to be said on the quantity and source of this transferred blood, is so strange and undreamed of that not only do I fear danger to myself from the malice of a few, but I dread lest I have all men as enemies, so much does habit or doctrine once absorbed become second nature, and so much does reverence for antiquity influence all men.”\\n\\nAugust 6, 2019", "Any condition that chronically raises the level of inflammation in the body can raise the risk of heart disease. This is true, as we found in an analysis I published with colleagues, even of diseases such as the skin condition psoriasis.24 Patients with psoriasis are much more likely to have heart attacks and strokes, and this occurs because these patients’ immune system is always going gangbusters, not only causing the angry skin lesions these patients have but leading to atherosclerotic plaque deposition in the blood vessels and eventually causing their rupture as well.\\n\\nAugust 10, 2019", "The history of heart disease, like so many others, makes it clear that sometimes the biggest impediments in the progress of science are the gatekeepers and opinion leaders of their respective fields. Yet an expert is by definition wedded to the status quo, and as their expertise grows, so does their relationship with the existing body of knowledge upon which their authority is recognized. In medical science, detours from the truth bear a heavy human cost, and a century of unchecked hypertension likely led to the deaths of millions upon millions of people from heart attacks and strokes. And all this knowledge of the ills of high blood pressure leads us to the most important question of all: What can we do to fix it?\\n\\nAugust 11, 2019", "However, opposition to cholesterol’s causative role in atherosclerosis persisted widely. In 1979, Sir John McMichael, one of the most prominent British cardiologists of his time, in an article in The British Medical Journal, called the recommendation to reduce dietary cholesterol “propaganda,” going on to write that atherosclerosis is a “wear-and tear disease”\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "Even the best possible trial could not make up for the fact that the treatments available were just terrible. Dietary restriction, on the other hand, while showing promise in some rigorous studies, was notoriously ineffective in the real world. The CPPT had helped push the lipid hypothesis forward, but its implications for patients were limited given how difficult taking the medication was. It became clear that an advance as distinct as, say, the iPhone was needed. Such an advance would be produced by a Japanese biochemist who was studying fungi in petri dishes, trying to find the next blockbuster antibiotic. Even in his wildest dreams, he never could have imagined what he would stumble upon.\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "Born in 1933, Akira Endo, in his own words, grew up in a “rural farming family in northern Japan, and found himself fascinated with molds and mushrooms as a child.22 He dreamed of one day becoming the next Alexander Fleming. Fleming (1881–1955), a studious microbiologist, was perhaps not the tidiest. He was investigating a common bacterium in petri dishes. One day when he showed up to his lab, a bacterial colony had been destroyed by fungus, which had contaminated one of the samples. When he cultured that fungus, he found that the mold juice that it produced had killed bacteria. He called that juice penicillin.\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "Akira Endo joined a Japanese pharmaceutical company, hoping that one of the molds he was studying would one day help him discover the successor to penicillin. When he came to New York for studies in the 1960s, there were aspects of American life there he found very alien. “I was very surprised by the large number of elderly and overweight people, and by the rather rich dietary habits,” he wrote. “In the residential area of the Bronx where I lived, there were many elderly couples living by themselves and I often saw ambulances going to take an elderly person who had suffered a heart attack to the hospital.”23 Endo thought that the same fungi that produced penicillin might also produce substances that could reduce the production of cholesterol, which was part of bacteria’s cell membrane. Back in Japan, his team tested more than 3,800 types of fungi before they hit pay dirt.\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "cholesterol is a fundamental ingredient for all living things, humans especially. Cholesterol, a critical part of the membrane of each cell, is a key ingredient in many hormones and substances such as bile, which assist with the absorption of food and are an essential component of the human brain. The liver’s production of cholesterol was likely necessary when fat was an infrequent component of our diets, but now that we have more than our fair share of cholesterol in our everyday foods, this production is probably not that necessary.\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "Endo tested this substance in animals, every one of whom, except rats, showed significant lowering of cholesterol. The reason it didn’t work in rats was because the enzyme that this drug blocked would rebound after a while in rats only, nullifying the beneficial effects. Endo teamed up with a Tokyo-based physician and began testing it in humans and early results were very promising. And then suddenly, everything came to a screeching halt. Some dogs treated with doses hundreds of times higher than necessary had developed what was thought to be intestinal cancer but was later found to be a noncancerous change occurring in the cells because of the enormous doses being used.24 Even as work at Endo’s company stalled out of an abundance of caution, another pharmaceutical company, Merck, developed a similar compound and, after finding no signal of risk in their studies, continued with the development of their product. That product was called lovastatin, the first statin drug to ever reach the market in 1987. Akira Endo had not discovered the next blockbuster antibiotic—without knowing it, he had discovered perhaps the most important medicine since penicillin.\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "Statins are so effective that no medication since their development thirty years ago has so far been shown to be better than they are, and it is incredibly difficult for any medication to show benefit when it is prescribed to someone already taking a statin.\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "When I emailed Akira Endo, who is eighty-four years old and retired, I never expected to hear back, but I did. According to him, it is clear what the greatest achievement in heart health is: “I think that cholesterol metabolism and prevention and treatment are the biggest advances.” On whether he was taking a statin, he wrote, “Both my wife and I have taken statins for more than ten years. I cannot tell you which one.”\\n\\nAugust 13, 2019", "He knew of at least six treatments available but wasn’t sure if any of them really worked, so he devised an experiment.24 He selected twelve sailors with very similar symptoms—all of them “had putrid gums, the spots and lassitude, with weakness of the knees.” He put them all in one place in the holds and gave them all a similar but terrible diet like water gruel sweetened with sugar for breakfast and fresh mutton broth for dinner. He then, supposedly at random, gave them the treatments he knew of. He gave two cider, two sulfuric acid, two vinegar, two seawater, two a mixture of nutmeg and garlic, and finally, gave two lemons and oranges. The results were remarkable—of the entire group, the patients who received lemons and oranges were fit for duty within a week and began nursing the others to health. This was, for most intents and purposes, the first “controlled” clinical trial performed in human history. He described these results in his book A Treatise of the Scurvy, published in 1753, but it took another fifty years for citrus to become the accepted treatment for scurvy.\\n\\nAugust 18, 2019", "James Lind’s experiment was important because he ensured that all the subjects in the trial were controlled, meaning both patients getting the intervention and those getting other therapies were similar. Bad things happen when experiments are not controlled. Suppose the patients getting citrus were sicker than those getting seawater, who had a milder deficiency. In that case, the patients receiving the citrus may have fared worse simply because they were sicker to begin with.\\n\\nAugust 18, 2019", "things like consent and humane treatment of subjects were largely seen as hurdles to scientific progress. Prostitutes in Germany were unknowingly infected with syphilis while cancer cells were being injected into patients in New York City.33 Many researchers argued that the ends justified the means, but Henry Beecher, an anesthesiologist at Harvard Medical School and one of medicine’s most famous whistle-blowers, argued, “A study is ethical or not at its inception. It does not become ethical merely because it turned up valuable data.” He went on to ask, “Whoever gave the investigator the godlike right of choosing martyrs?”\\n\\nAugust 18, 2019", "With the advent of the controlled trial, another frequent ethical slip was the deprivation of treatment to patients in the control arm of trials. Before a trial is started, scientists today are asked to determine if there is scientific equipoise. What does that mean? Well, imagine there is a new treatment for dementia, and you want to perform a randomized trial for this new treatment. What type of treatment will patients in the control arm get? Is it ethical to withhold the treatment being studied from the patients getting the placebo? With dementia, given that there are almost no evidence-based treatments for it, it may be fair to provide no additional treatment to the patients in the control arm.\\n\\nAugust 18, 2019", "The fact is that in medical circles, the study was far from secret, and reports from it had been published almost fifteen times in medical literature. In fact, in 1965, a young doctor just out of medical school, Irwin Schatz, after reading one of these results in a medical journal, wrote a letter to the researchers in charge of the study, expressing his outrage. “I am utterly astounded by the fact that physicians allow patients with a potentially fatal disease to remain untreated when effective therapy is available,”\\n\\nAugust 18, 2019", "The fact is that I would rather trust a finding with a P value of 0.06 in a randomized controlled clinical trial than a P value of \\u003c0.0001 in an observational study. If what you seek is truth, and if what you abhor is random chance, the P value is only one small piece of the puzzle, yet that is not how most view this conundrum, and changes in medicine and computing are about to make P value fever a whole lot worse.\\n\\nAugust 19, 2019", "the proliferation of numbers has led to the emergence of what has been called Data Rich, Information Poor (DRIP) Syndrome. Personally, I have helped lead analyses that included at times hundreds of thousands of patients. Almost each and every relationship between two different groups of patients within these databases can be statistically significant but totally worthless in real life. Why? With large data sets these days, the P value for even the smallest differences can be very low, even if the actual difference between the two results is miniscule and meaningless.\\n\\nAugust 19, 2019", "Loath as they may be to admit it, most doctors and researchers also get most of their information not from scientific conferences or medical journals but from the internet, just like everyone else.\\n\\nAugust 20, 2019", "The singular focus that many clinicians have on the magical effects of modern allopathic medicine, however, can obscure a major aspect of what they do—the human aspect. A huge contributor to the therapeutic effect of almost everything we prescribe has nothing to do with what’s in the pill or what we are doing with stents in someone’s heart. It has everything to do with how physicians listen to patients, how they examine them, how they connect with them as human beings, and how they respond to their symptoms, allay their fears, reassure them that they are in the best of hands and that all their concerns will be addressed.\\n\\nAugust 20, 2019", "How can docs help? Listening to patients’ stories—shockingly—helps. Patients of physicians who are more empathetic are more likely to adhere to the medications they have been prescribed.38 Patients of surgeons who provided them not only clear instructions but gave them encouragement have lesser pain and are able to leave the hospital sooner.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2019", "At the turn of the millennium, troponins were added to the definition of how heart attacks are defined, and this fundamentally changed what even constitutes a heart attack.40 It allowed many patients who clearly were having ongoing damage to the heart to be diagnosed and then treated with either medications and procedures. This included people like Lucy, who, if it hadn’t been for troponins, might never have been diagnosed with a heart attack. In fact, we know that women’s symptoms are more likely to be not taken as seriously as men’s. Yet troponins are far from perfect, and in many cases, troponins can be elevated in the absence of a heart attack.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2019", "Not only that, there are conditions where there is extensive breakdown of muscle such as after someone has run a marathon or kidney failure when the body fails to excrete troponins that can cause them to be elevated.\\n\\nAugust 25, 2019", "The cath lab teaches us that the time to act is not when there are no consequences but when inaction is the greatest consequence itself.\\n\\nAugust 27, 2019", "Sones was shaken but understood the gravity of what had happened. He reached out to others who had inadvertently pushed contrast into coronary arteries but only heard horror stories. Yet Sones was determined to do it right, because he understood that being able to actually see what’s inside the coronary arteries could be an epochal advance, though even he likely didn’t foresee what lay ahead. Years later, he wrote in a letter, “With considerable fear and trepidation we embarked on a program to accomplish the objective.” Instead of using the 40–50 cc of contrast that he had been using for the aorta, he used a much smaller dose that adequately filled and opacified the coronary arteries without sending the patient into cardiac standstill.\\n\\nAugust 27, 2019", "Getting pregnant has a profound effect on the body, including the function of the heart. The expansion in blood volume necessitates the heart to beat both harder and faster.\\n\\nAugust 28, 2019", "In the United States, even though millions of people have heart failure, the number of hearts available for donation is only around three thousand per year, and that is only because so many young people have been dying recently because of the opioid epidemic. Lydia knew that it could be months before she could find a good match.\\n\\nSeptember 6, 2019", "almost seventy years on, one can argue that the golden age of cardiology is only now being fully realized. Just a few years ago, if Lydia had a dead heart in her chest, the surgeons might have been calling the morgue. But the surgeons didn’t pronounce her dead, or call her family to arrange for her funeral, or perform an autopsy. Instead, they implanted mechanical pumps right into her new heart to whir blood throughout her body. Despite the odds, Lydia survived with the mechanical pumps long enough for a third heart to become available for her after a few months. This time, everything went as planned; the heart took to her body like a baby cub takes to her mother. Lydia is no longer in the hospital. She is back in the big country where she was always destined to be. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) haven’t just changed how we deal with heart disease. They represent the dawn of a new era in human life—the union of man and machine—and have implications not only for how we treat heart failure but for what it means to be human.\\n\\nSeptember 6, 2019", "LVADs are mechanical pumps that are surgically implanted into patient’s left ventricles, the pumping chamber of the heart. Initially, most patients received an LVAD while they waited in a hospital in the hope that they would get a heart transplant. Some got their wish, but many others never did. Just in the past decade, twenty thousand patients in the United States have received an LVAD.2 These people rarely have a pulse, and if you do CPR on their chest, they might actually die because of it. They have an LVAD sewn into their practically vestigial heart to do its work. At any moment, if these patients’ batteries discharge, they can die, yet they aren’t stowed away in hospitals; they are roaming the streets, lifting weights in the gym, and shopping on Black Friday, doing many things they were able to do before their hearts gave up on them. Some of them call themselves LVAD Warriors, and they might represent the future of mankind.\\n\\nSeptember 6, 2019", "What makes heart failure such a challenging disease is how difficult it can be to take care of sick heart failure patients at home. Heart failure, in fact, is the most common cause of admissions to the hospital for older adults in the United States\\n\\nSeptember 6, 2019", "The heart, for all its wonders, has one Achilles’ heel: heart muscle is very poor at regenerating. A heart once damaged can rarely, if ever, heal. Therefore, even though there are medications and procedures that can prevent the heart’s function from potentially worsening, there is little that can be done about a heart scarred. While heart transplantation can be an option for a few patients, it comes with its own set of challenges. Patients who receive a heart transplant have to take special medications that suppress the immune system. These medications prevent the body’s immune system from rejecting the foreign heart. Yet because they dampen the body’s immunity, this can lead to the person becoming very susceptible to infections both common and obscure that can practically affect any part of the body. These medications have to be taken religiously, without fail, for years and years, and not taking them can have disastrous consequences.\\n\\nSeptember 6, 2019", "He had a routine ultrasound a few weeks earlier that showed that his heart function was normal, but I wanted a second look. As soon as the images started being broadcast on the ultrasound machine, though, that was reduced to a distant memory—Peter’s heart was barely moving. It certainly seemed like his body was rejecting his heart. I turned toward Peter and asked him this time with more than a hint of perturbation if he had been taking his medications. He confessed that for the past few weeks, he hadn’t taken them. He told me he couldn’t afford them. “I am sorry,” he told me over and over again, even as I tried to tell him it was okay. I gave him a hefty dose of steroids to blast his immune system into submission, but he seemed to only be getting worse.\\n\\nSeptember 6, 2019", "In 2010, the FDA approved the first LVAD for destination therapy, meaning that the LVAD by itself was now the destination, the constant companion of the patient until he or she met their eventual end. It was this change that helped exponentially increase the number of patients receiving LVADs. LVADs are very effective at improving heart failure, yet they come with a serious set of complications. LVAD patients have very high rates of bleeding since the pumps chew up clotting factors. These patients also need to religiously take blood thinners to prevent the formation of blood clots within the pump, another complication that can lead to stroke. The driveline remains the Achilles’ heel of LVAD technology given that it represents a permanent conduit between the sterile inside of the body and the rampaging cacophony of germs in the outside world. This leads to a very high risk of infections.\\n\\nSeptember 8, 2019", "through several Facebook groups such as LVAD Warriors or LVAD Friends, you will realize that these virtual groups give LVAD patients something that neither doctors nor nurses, neither family nor friends can give. As a fly on the wall in these groups, I catch a vivid window into the realms of people whose lives are marked as much by heroic peaks of joy as spiraling depths of despair. Every member has this sense that they have somehow cheated death, that they are alive because of a technology only a few in the world can access and one that didn’t exist until just a few years ago. LVADs let them have babies, get married, be around for their children’s and grandchildren’s graduations, and so forth. When they dress up to go to a party, they post pictures, letting everyone know they haven’t quite given up on life yet. All this comes at a toll that can be too much for some to withstand. Having an LVAD requires constant and incessant care of the device, the driveline coming out of the skin, the dressings used to cover it, the batteries that always need to be charged, monitoring of the pump at all times to make sure that it is functioning right, and on and on and on. No one person alone can ever take care of an LVAD, and having robust social support is a prerequisite to getting an LVAD. The need for almost 24-7 caregiver support can place a heavy burden on family members, many of whom I have seen relocating and changing or leaving jobs\\n\\nSeptember 8, 2019", "Having an LVAD can make some people feel like they are trapped. “I sometimes wake up and remember that this is my life and for a second I have to convince myself,” posted a woman. “This life isn’t for the weak … but it’s hard to be a warrior every day.” Another woman described walking into a rural hotel bar with her LVAD and everyone stopped talking. “When we got outside I said to my husband that I think these farmers thought I might be [wearing] a suicide belt or special weapons,” she wrote. “If they had asked I would have told them I was from the future.” Some, within the same sentence, expressed a dueling sense of deep gratitude and gloom. “The LVAD made me feel as if I was half robot … lol … it is a journey that I would not wish upon my worst enemy … yet I am so grateful that this option was there for me … you can do this, LVAD warrior.” When a patient was depressed, asking the group if they could just be truthful and say they all hated their LVAD, another replied, “Don’t fight the VAD. Kick its butt and make it your bitch.”\\n\\nSeptember 8, 2019", "Some people do so well with their LVADs that they even give up the opportunity to be listed for a transplant. For many patients with LVADs, the greatest inconvenience is having to wear their batteries around their waist, yet one of my senior mentors, who has witnessed the transformation of heart failure care with his own eyes, put things into perspective for a patient. “We never thought people would live long enough to complain about the size of the batteries,” said Dr. Joe Rogers to me in clinic one day. A very small number of patients with LVADs actually do experience something quite unusual—recovery of the function of their native hearts.\\n\\nSeptember 8, 2019", "The fact is that even as there is such a dramatic focus on treating heart disease, the future may be more about making sure a heart never gets diseased to begin with. As we have learned, once the heart is damaged and muscle turns to scar, there is no way back. Yet not only do we have a myriad of means to minimize the risk of heart disease already available, we have reinforcements on the way. There are medications called PCSK9 inhibitors now available that can annihilate bad cholesterol in our bodies.25 Yet PCSK9 inhibitors can cost tens of thousands of dollars and are unaffordable for the vast majority. There are other medications in development that patients only need to take once or twice a year that could serve as a virtual vaccine against atherosclerosis.26\\n\\nSeptember 8, 2019", "In the next century, heart health needs to be viewed as a right rather than a privilege.\\n\\nSeptember 8, 201"]
