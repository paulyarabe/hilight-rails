book_notes = ["Successful development of a major new pharmaceutical product typically returns revenue that is approximately 500 times the development investment. In general, pre-tax profit is 50% or more of revenue; thus, successful drug development is capable of generating an after-tax return on investment of about 15,000% (assuming a 40% tax rate). This extremely high potential return is what drives investments in the pharmaceutical business.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "a core competency of a successful pharmaceutical company is management of development risk.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "This is because, like most endeavors in life, success in drug development requires education and experience in drug development.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "At its heart, the drug development process is an exercise in risk management. Successful drug developers are skilled at estimating and mitigating risk. They know how to prioritize the development process so the maximum amount of risk is eliminated at the smallest possible cost in time and money.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "A successful drug developer often has a nervous energy that is apparent from across the room. He or she has no tolerance for nebulous statements and is typically fanatically concerned with honesty, often to the point of committing social faux pas. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, within limits, is a powerful asset, since successful development requires meticulous attention to details and the ability to focus intensely on the task at hand. The polished, well-dressed, socially-adept individual is less likely to be successful as a drug developer although they may be very valuable in other contexts. A very expensive watch may be a sign of high risk. Look for one on the wrist of the head of business development not the head of drug development.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "September 20, 2020", "only about 8 people are needed for a successful project team. The key is to get the correct people. Increasing the number of people does not compensate for having inexperienced or inappropriate personnel. In fact, having excess personnel magnifies the deficiencies of each by tending to blur lines of responsibility and authority.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "One common misconception is that development projects are difficult to find. During the course of over two decades in the pharmaceutical business, I have evaluated many hundreds and perhaps more than a thousand projects; typically one or more a week. A number of these could be or have been successfully developed into new drugs. During the course of a day, I often have one or more ideas for projects that could potentially merit development. The challenge for a drug developer like myself (as opposed to a drug discoverer) is to select the product that is most likely to be commercially successful. This is especially important because the drug-development process is very expensive, and resources naturally need to be employed in the most efficient manner.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "The discussion that follows assumes that a potential drug candidate has a well-defined, single indication. Although this is true in many cases, most new molecular entities have multiple potential indications. In this case each indication should be evaluated separately, using the criteria laid out in this section. Once adequate analyses are in hand, each indication can be prioritized based on its estimated chances for successful development and its ability to satisfy an unmet medical need. It is important to remember that if the evaluations for an indication fail, financial and political support for the project will likely decrease dramatically making it impossible to evaluate alternate indications. So it is important to choose the initial indication or indications carefully.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Typically, new drugs are first characterized by identifying their proposed mechanism of action. A proposed new drug may bind to a receptor in the body that is well known to be involved in a disease process. An important determinant of the chance for success of the putative new drug is the robustness of the relationship between the proposed mechanism of action and influence on the disease process. If there are other drugs with the same mechanism of action that are well proven to be effective, it is more likely that a new drug will also be effective.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "The effects of drugs are generally dependent on the amount used and therefore careful attention should be paid to the amount of drug required in order to obtain a desired effect. In general, drug concentrations in the pico or nanomolar range are desirable, because most molecules do not have meaningful toxicity at such concentrations. Thus, with luck, such a product will have clinical adverse effects related only to its mechanism of action at the dilute concentrations required for efficacy.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "It is often possible for a skilled medicinal chemist or biochemist to assess the potential for metabolism of a new molecule based on its chemical structure prior to actual laboratory metabolism measurements. It is important to consider metabolism because the body is exposed not just to the product administered but also to all the new molecules that result as the body breaks it down via the process of metabolism. Each metabolite, therefore, is essentially a new drug with the potential for both side effects and efficacy. If the metabolite is more efficacious than the drug being tested, the metabolite should, in general, be used instead. If it is significantly less potent, then it provides only the potential for side effects and is undesirable. Furthermore, metabolism increases the potential for interactions with other drugs patients may be taking, an important source of drug toxicity in clinical practice. Thus, products with few or no metabolites are generally more desirable than those with many metabolites.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Early toxicology studies of new drug candidates should include evaluations for severe toxicity that may make use in humans impossible. These should include evaluations for potential to cause cancer and unacceptable effects on heart rhythm. Mutagenicity testing and hERG studies address these two issues and should be done early in development since they are relatively inexpensive and adverse findings may make successful development impossible independent of any other findings. These are generally supplemented by evaluations designed to detect a wider spectrum of potential toxicity and include general toxicology studies and safety pharmacology studies.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Mutagenicity testing entails looking for adverse effects on DNA, and is done both in vitro and in vivo following highly standardized methods detailed in relevant regulatory guidelines. Data from two mutagenicity tests; an Ames test and a chromosomal aberration test should be in hand prior to human exposure\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Since these kinds of tests are relatively quick and inexpensive, it is sometimes worth doing them early, for example prior to initiating human trials, since favorable results lower the risk of problems later on. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some carcinogenicity can be tolerated if the expected life span of the patients who will receive the drug is short, due to age or illness.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Generally, initial studies are conducted to evaluate tolerability in a gross manner, such as effects on body weight, behavior and survival. These early studies are typically used to estimate the doses for later studies to detect more subtle adverse effects. The guidelines for design of these toxicology studies are specified by the International Committee on Harmonization and should be carefully consulted before any toxicology studies are undertaken. Toxicity is typically evaluated in a rodent and a non-rodent species (usually the dog).\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Such studies typically involve evaluation of obvious behavioral signs and as well as evaluation of lesions observed by gross observation (not using a microscope) on necropsy. The single-dose tests usually don’t involve microscopic evaluation of tissues (histopathology) although this can be included if the toxicity observed grossly seems to warrant it.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Once the general ranges of tolerable doses are identified in each species, longer studies must be conducted. These studies should include doses that approach, but do not achieve, lethal doses, so that the non-lethal side-effects can be studied more carefully. Such sub-chronic studies typically include evaluation of histopathology, and organ weights, in addition to gross evaluations and evaluations of effects on behavior, blood chemistries, blood cells, coagulation, etc. These later studies must be conducted according to “Good Laboratory Practice” Guidelines, which specify strict record-keeping and verification of the procedures of the study, including potency of the drug used. In general, the maximum exposure of humans is limited to the duration of the longest toxicology studies which must be carried out in a rodent (usually rat) and non-rodent (usually dog) species\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Typically, studies of at least one month are completed prior to human dosing.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "It is critical to objectively contemplate the likely toxic effects related to a drug’s mechanism of action and look for them aggressively.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Safety Pharmacology is typically assessed initially by an evaluation of the drug’s of effects on a large panel of drug receptor binding assays (to look for unexpected pharmacologic actions). In addition, effects on rodent kidney and pulmonary function, and effects on dog cardiovascular function and behavior are evaluated.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Assessments of blood levels of the drug and its metabolites are typically included in the safety pharmacology and sub-chronic toxicology studies. This is called evaluation of toxicokinetics. These will later be compared with blood levels in human volunteers to assure that the blood levels in the volunteers remain well below levels associated with meaningful toxicity in animals. In addition, the levels of the major drug metabolites should, in general, also be kept below the levels associated with animal toxicity and therefore metabolites should be assessed in the blood of the toxicology animals as well.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Metabolites are typically first assessed using in vitro studies of liver cells or cell components from the rodent and non-rodent toxicology species, which are then compared with results from human cells. A qualitative difference between human and animal metabolism may be a reason to consider changing the species used for the toxicology evaluations. Once the main metabolites are identified in vitro, they are assayed in blood samples from animals used in the toxicology studies. The initial human study typically involves assessment of ascending single-doses of the drug, which are generally limited to doses below the levels that cause meaningful toxicity in animals.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "If possible, the comparisons of tolerability should be done in the same animal species and via the same route of administration as were used for the evaluations of efficacy, so that the safety and efficacy results can be compared.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "The ratios of the NOAEL dose in the safety studies to the doses that are effective in the efficacy studies is the animal analog of the therapeutic ratio that will be investigated in human studies, and is often similar in animals and humans. Thus, it is important that this ratio be as high as possible. Anything less than 10 should be\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Once the non-clinical efficacy and safety data are in hand, it is important to have a formal assessment of the risks and benefits of proceeding to human studies. This should include assessments by experts in evaluation of preclinical and human safety data and usually include an assessment by a physician\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Irreversible toxicity is also a concern especially when the toxic signs are severe or disabling.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "One might think decisions on the risk/benefit of proceeding to human studies would be relatively simple. In practice, they are often extremely difficult. By the time a complete database of safety and efficacy data are in hand, considerable time and money have been expended. Thus, a decision not to proceed may be very painful to the company and individuals within it. The ability to make this judgment objectively is perhaps one of the most important qualities of a successful drug-development team. Given the low numbers of new drug approvals, it seems that wrong decisions are frequent occurrences.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "However, in certain cases, such as the healthy-volunteer studies to be discussed in the following section, there may be no benefit to the study participants other than the payment they receive as compensation for their participation. In that case, the risk must be held to a minimal level. In general, when there is only financial benefit to the participants the risk of participation should be no greater than the risks associated with ordinary life activities, such as driving to the study center.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Since evaluation of risk to human study participants is very important, the drug laws of most countries require multiple approvals for clinical studies, all of which must be satisfied before a single study participant is enrolled. These include review by the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the study, government regulators, the clinical investigator(s) implementing the study, review by an independent committee of experts (“Institutional Review Committee” in the US and “Ethics Committee” in the EU), and finally, by the study participant.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "The evaluation by the study participants is done based on an informed consent document which summarizes all the data relevant to their evaluation of the risks and benefits of participation in the study. Since most study participants are not experts in drug development, it is important that the information be presented in words that are understandable to them; avoiding complex technical terms and concepts as much as possible. These considerations exemplify the required ethical behavior expected by society and required by law and regulation and they also serve as protection for the sponsor if the unexpected should happen.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "However, the decision to deliberately fail to develop a potentially valuable drug expeditiously is surprisingly common and represents an ethical issue that is rarely considered or addressed in our society. For example, a life-saving drug might not be developed because the potential market is considered too small, or because the product does not fit with the overall direction of the company. In addition, as described above, there are many factors unrelated to commercial success of a product that can delay its development. When, as is general practice, the product is patented, this kind of decision can deprive patients of life-saving therapies for the duration of the patent protection, typically 20 years or more. When a patented product is known to possess unique and important clinical benefit, the decision not to pursue development or the inability to move development forward expeditiously, represent ethical issues, for they deny society at large an important and possibly life-saving medication. One of my motivations for writing this book is to help companies develop drugs more quickly and inexpensively so that more can enter the development process.\\n\\nSeptember 20, 2020", "Since the reporting requirement is an ongoing obligation, newly obtained information must be carefully evaluated for evidence of new risks. It is critical to have adequate human resources (including a licensed physician) and standard operating procedures in place to meet these reporting requirements prior to starting human studies. Often, the first standard operating procedure for the clinical development group covers reporting of safety information.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "In almost all cases, clinical holds can be avoided via a pre-IND meeting with FDA (and/or equivalent meeting with other regulatory authorities). A pre-IND meeting should be scheduled at a time when enough data are in hand to allow a reasonable assessment of the risks and benefits of starting human studies so they can be presented to the FDA reviewers. Such a meeting is preceded by submission of a Briefing Document summarizing key data and highlighting any potential problems or controversial points. It also includes a list of questions for the FDA reviewers to consider. It is far better to clear up any issues before the IND is submitted, even if it takes some extra time, than to suffer the long delays caused by a clinical hold. The pre-IND meeting is also an excellent time to review the entire clinical program and the desired labeling, and get feedback from the FDA before a large investment in clinical trials. The FDA (and other national regulatory agencies) often has very strict constraints on the nature of the indications they will grant. Since the approved indications are critical to the commercial success of a product, it is very important to obtain agreement that the desired indications are acceptable to relevant regulatory agencies.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "I cannot over-emphasize the importance of maintaining a collaborative relationship with national regulatory authorities: it speeds the development process many fold and can lower costs dramatically.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "Because the regulatory meetings are so important, it is critical to have experienced people prepare the Briefing Document and attend the meeting. Every attempt to look at things from the FDA’s perspective should be made in advance of the meeting to maximize the chance that they will find the plans acceptable.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "The main objective of Phase I testing is to evaluate the toxicity profile of the product in humans. The first choice that needs to be made is whether to evaluate the toxicity in healthy volunteers or patients. Healthy volunteers offer the advantage of having relatively few (expected) adverse events so that the toxicity of the new drug can be distinguished most easily from unrelated concomitant events. In addition, because their systems are not compromised by illness, healthy volunteers can often tolerate unexpected toxicity better than patients. Thus, assuming the expected toxicities (based on the animal experiments) are relatively benign, and assuming the doses to be tested are much lower than (by 100-fold or more below) the doses that cause severe or lethal toxicity (not to be confused with the NOAEL which is generally much lower than the minimum lethal dose) in animals, healthy human volunteers are typically used for initial studies. When meaningful toxicity is expected, there must be some counter-balancing benefit to the phase I participants. Thus, patients who may benefit from the treatment are typically used in this situation. It is important to remember that the risk/ benefit ratio must always show minimal net risk, or in the case where the risk is more than minimal, a net benefit for the study participants. Be advised that net benefit to the world at large is not a justification for putting individual patients at more than minimal risk (e.g., the risk of driving to the study site) without a balancing benefit.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "The first dose studied should be no more than 1/10th the highest dose associated with no adverse effects (NOAEL) in the most sensitive of the animal safety studies. Once the safety of the initial dose level is established, a dose that is double the initial dose can usually be investigated. Then, doses can be repeatedly doubled until unacceptable toxicity is encountered or a dose is reached that should reasonably be expected to have maximal efficacy.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "Although severe toxicity is very rarely encountered in phase I studies, minor adverse events are common. Typically headache, dizziness, nausea, and upper respiratory symptoms are seen because these are commonly seen in untreated healthy populations. In order to help distinguish between drug-related and unrelated adverse events, it is prudent to include a few placebo-treated subjects at each dose level evaluated. A typical study design would include 6 subjects treated with active drug and 2 treated with placebo. The study should be blinded so that the clinical investigator cannot be sure who is on active and who is on placebo.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "Although usually not feasible, incorporation of evaluations of efficacy parameters should be considered in the phase I studies. These parameters may be the same as those used in definitive studies of efficacy or may be surrogates known to predict the results of more definitive studies. Surrogates should only be used if they are well established to be predictive of clinical efficacy in definitive studies. If no evidence of efficacy is found at maximally well-tolerated doses, then discontinuation of development of the product should be seriously considered.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "Demonstration of equivalence among the different batches and lots of drug substance and product is typically done using two methods. Dissolution testing evaluates the rate at which the drug product dissolves in simulated gastric and/or intestinal fluid. This kind of testing is used to demonstrate equivalence of products that are manufactured using very similar methods. When larger changes in manufacturing are necessary during development, then bioequivalence between the differing lots needs to be established. This can be done using a bioequivalence study of standard design. In some cases, changes in the drug substance or product can be made without the need to show equivalence to the prior product. This is true when the new product will completely supplant the prior product, and it is not necessary to use the prior data to support directly the final new drug application. However, it should be remembered that small changes in a drug product or substance can result in large changes of performance, and it can be dangerous to assume that products are the same if the manufacturing methods have changed. Remember that certain quality standards will apply to a drug product. At the beginning of the development program, it will be impossible to know how well these quality standards are maintained during storage of the drug product. Thus, the quality must be re-evaluated periodically to assure that the product is not changing by a meaningful amount. Each lot of drug product should therefore have an associated “re-test” date when it must be re-tested to assure its continuing quality. Once re-tested, a new re-test date should be established, if appropriate. If the product fails its re-test, it should not be administered to humans. Setting appropriate re-test dates is very important when planning the longer studies described in the following section. Since a drug product that fails re-testing can no longer be used, re-test failures during a large clinical trial can be a very serious problem, for example, requiring a study to be stopped prior to completion. Conducting larger, longer studies can be very demanding and it is easy to forget to conduct re-testing at the scheduled times. Thus, it is important to have appropriate controls in place to assure that re-testing is done at the scheduled intervals and that studies are not started using drug supplies that are expected to expire prior to completion of the last patient’s participation.\\n\\nSeptember 21, 2020", "Phase II is the most important stage of drug development, because it is usually the first time it is possible to evaluate both efficacy and safety in humans using standard efficacy parameters. An acceptable efficacy and safety profile is the key to drug approval. As explained in Chapter 1, a “drug” consists of the actual product as well as its conditions of use. In particular, the dose regimen is a key component of a “drug.” Phase I, if properly implemented, should provide the basis for determining the approximate dose regimen that will be both effective (based on blood levels in humans compared with effective levels/ concentrations in animal studies) and well-tolerated (based on the side-effect profile seen in the phase I studies).\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "The first phase II study should also include a dose that is considered too low to be effective; including such a low dose should allow determination of a well-defined dose-response relationship when the study is completed with placebo, an ineffective dose, an effective dose, and a higher effective dose, which shows that no greater efficacy is obtained by pushing up the dose. The results at the ineffective dose can be used to answer questions from regulators about whether the doses used in later trials could be lowered to improve tolerability.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "In addition, any surrogate endpoint data obtained in phase I should be included in the analysis. I cannot emphasize how important it is to estimate the phase II doses as rigorously as possible. This is because the failure of a phase II study may completely doom a product that would otherwise have great utility.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "The chances of successful development to a commercial product are still small before phase II is completed. Therefore, it is prudent to limit the cost and time dedicated to phase II studies. This can be done by limiting the duration of the patients’ participation in the study and using proven surrogate endpoints, rather than the endpoints required for regulatory approval. It is important to balance the cost and time savings achieved using a short duration and/or a surrogate endpoint versus the predictive strength of the phase II study; cost and time savings for a study with little predictive value for the definitive efficacy trials are illusory. If a long study is required to show evidence of efficacy and no reliable surrogate endpoints are available, then the Phase II study should use the standard duration and endpoints required by regulators to show definitive evidence of efficacy.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "If the study can’t be shortened or use surrogate endpoints, then the “phase II” study will actually have the same design as a pivotal phase III study (see Chapter 7), and thus could potentially be used as one of the pivotal efficacy studies needed for final marketing approval. When this is done, a company can use a single study to pass two critical steps toward approval, completion of phase II and completion of one of the two required “pivotal” clinical trials.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "The proper design of phase II studies requires detailed knowledge of: (i) the disease state being studied, (ii) concomitant medications that will be used by the study participants including their typical side effects, (iii) the availability of the patient group being contemplated for inclusion in the study, and (iv) many other details affecting study design and implementation. There are two sources of information that can be used to aid with these practical issues of study design and implementation: clinical investigators and advisors. Investigators who will be considered for participation in the phase II trial, are typically academics who work at large university medical or other clinical centers and make significant income by doing clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies. Scientific advisors are also frequently from the same kind of background. However, they are retained as independent advisors who will not be recruiting or treating patients in a study.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "The fact that clinical investigators participate in the conduct of clinical studies means that they have an inherent conflict of interest with a pharmaceutical company that employs them as a scientific advisor on study design and implementation; this is because as a scientific advisor, they stand to profit financially by recommending a study that they (and perhaps only they) can implement. For this reason, scientific advisors should be kept separate from potential investigators who will implement the study. This limits the potential for conflicts of interest. However, even scientific advisors, who are told at the outset that they will not be involved in clinical trials may benefit by directing studies to colleagues with whom they have relationships.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "it is best to meet with scientific advisors one at a time. This minimizes the potential for time wasted with introductions, posturing, and competition for recognition and attention by the advisors. It also reduces the need to resolve scheduling conflicts among advisors who are typically very busy. It may be impossible to reach absolute consensus on a study design among multiple advisors. If so, it will be up to the company representatives to weigh the various opinions and make a decision.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "it will typically be important to identify several experts with complementary knowledge in order to assure all areas are covered. These complementary areas of expertise represent another reason to try to discuss issues with each expert separately, so that each discussion can be tailored to the relevant area of expertise rather than asking very busy members of a group to wait until their area of expertise comes up on a meeting agenda. In my experience, this is a common problem in group meetings with scientific advisors.\\n\\nSeptember 23, 2020", "As a practical matter, relevant regulators should be contacted and asked to schedule a meeting (I call this an “End-of-Phase I Meeting”) as soon as it is clear that a draft phase II protocol can be available in time for the meeting. The FDA will require a Briefing Document for the meeting at least 1 month in advance, and this requirement should be respected absolutely or they may cancel the meeting. The Briefing Document should contain background information on the compound, including a detailed summary of the phase I results, animal efficacy, toxicology and metabolism data and a list of questions the sponsor would like answered. In general, the information should be the same as the Briefing Document for the Pre-IND Meeting updated with the latest available data.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "As previously discussed for the Pre-IND Meeting, any potential risks or problems should be highlighted and discussed openly with regulators. Never conceal information or present it in a biased manner, since it is likely that such a deception will eventually have to be disclosed as development continues and the later it is disclosed, the greater will be the regulator’s irritation.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "Always take regulatory advice to heart. Since regulators cannot compel a company to do things in a particular way unless they feel there is a safety risk, they often temper their language. Even relatively mild qualifications like “we suggest” or “we have found it is best” should be heard as “you had better do it this way or else.” Regulators are usually very knowledgeable about the problems occurring in development and their advice should always be taken seriously. If it is not possible to follow their advice, it is best to tell them so as soon as possible and to work out a compromise that they find acceptable. It is almost always a bad idea to disregard the regulators’ recommendations without telling them clearly that you intend to do so and hearing what they have to say before you proceed. Regulators will typically issue minutes following an End-of-Phase I Meeting. Hopefully, these minutes will codify critical agreements between the company and regulators.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "The implementation of phase II studies is typically much more challenging than implementation of phase I because the endpoints being assessed are typically more complex to measure than the pharmacokinetic and safety endpoints assessed in phase I. This is especially true for drugs affecting the central nervous system where effects may be based on patient self-reporting and/or subjective evaluations by the clinical investigator. In addition, phase II studies are typically conducted at sites that mostly deal with patients who are not in clinical trials so they may have less of the infrastructure necessary to collect accurate data. Therefore, it is critically important to have an experienced clinical operations specialist who can evaluate sites for capacity, patient population, and the likely accuracy and integrity of their data. Phase II studies often require use of more than one investigator site to enroll the required number of patients. When multiple sites are used, a pre-study meeting of the investigators should be scheduled.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "Successfully completing a phase II study by demonstrating efficacy in humans is a pivotal step in the drug development process and if accomplished successfully, it adds a great deal of value to the product. While this is very beneficial for the company that owns the product, it is also the point at which competition over control of the project increases. Everyone wants to be involved with a winner, and if possible, to be in charge. The increase in value that is so essential to the company, often brings out the worst in the personalities involved. Skilled drug-development personnel must have a plan in place to defend their leadership positions or they will often find that new, more “professional” people are suddenly put in charge. These new people may be only skilled political operatives with poor drug development skills and/or impaired ethical principles, who can cause problems when they try to implement the remainder of the development program. It is the responsibility of upper management to defend the positions of the people who have successfully navigated through phase II. Allowing them to be pushed aside sends a powerful message throughout the company, that superior performance is not rewarded. This can be a fatal message for a company whose future often depends on high performance of its technical personnel. Conversely, the next step, phase III is more demanding than phase II so it is critical to be sure the development team is adequate to the task.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "Phase III trials are designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product in large numbers of patients using the efficacy endpoints accepted by regulators as definitive. Since the trials are designed to show the safety and efficacy of the product to be marketed, it is important that the drug substance and product be representative of the final product proposed for marketing. Thus, many expensive manufacturing activities will be required prior to the start of and in parallel with phase III. Of course all of the data accumulated prior to initiation of phase III should have been obtained using product that is representative of what will ultimately be marketed. So, adequate studies must be done to assure that the product lots used in all the studies will be acceptable to support approval of the marketed product. Special attention should be given to impurities and degradants.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "It is of great value to have successful phase II data available prior to initiating phase III. These data should confirm that the mechanism of action found in animal studies is applicable in humans. If possible, pharmacodynamic endpoints that verify the non-clinical mechanism of action should be in hand at the end of phase II. In addition, it is of great value to include the standard evaluations required for final FDA approval in phase II.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "The effect size (the difference in clinical response between active drug and placebo patients) and variability of the efficacy results found in phase II can then be used for statistical power calculations for the phase III studies.\\n\\nSeptember 24, 2020", "Power calculations deserve special attention. These relate to the number of patients required in order to have a reasonable chance of success. The results of power calculations are usually expressed as the percent chance of success assuming the drug works as expected. It is normal to use studies that have 80 to 90% power. This means the studies have a 10 to 20% chance of failing even if the drug works as expected. Power calculations are based on the expected “effect size” (for example the magnitude of the difference between active drug and placebo) and the variability of the efficacy data. It is absolutely critical to use realistic conservative assumptions.\\n\\nSeptember 26, 2020", "There are usually investigators who question the study design and procedures during the investigator meeting. Although it is important to consider these suggestions carefully, modifications made during the investigator meeting generally represent a failure in preparation by the development team. These late changes often have unintended consequences, since they are made after power calculations are complete, budgets negotiated, discussions with regulators completed, etc. The last activity of the meeting should be some relatively inviting recreation. This will provide an incentive for the investigators and their staff to remain for the full duration of the meeting and allow them to meet company staff in an informal setting.\\n\\nSeptember 26, 2020", "During the conduct of phase III, the final manufacturing activities needed for the NDA must be completed. This typically involves synthesis of 3 large-scale batches of drug substance and three large-scale batches of each strength of drug product. The drug product batches should contain at least 10% of the number of doses that are intended to be produced in each commercial batch. For a major product, each large-scale batch would contain at least 100,000 or more doses. It is best if these batches can be used for the actual phase III studies. If this is not possible, the NDA batches must have the same or lower levels of impurities and degradants than the amounts in the batches used for the clinical trials, so that the commercial product can be considered to be of the same or higher quality compared with the product used in the studies in the NDA application.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "An NDA typically requires at least 6 to 9 months of stability data for both the drug substance and product in the same containers that will be used commercially. Production must be carefully timed: it must be completed early enough so that carefully monitored data supporting an adequate shelf-life (potency, impurities and degradants must remain within acceptable levels) are available at the time the NDA is to be submitted. Yet, the production of the large-scale batches is expensive and so they should not be manufactured until the investment can be justified based on estimates of the risk-reward ratio for the phase III studies.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Although it is impossible to assure the outcome of the efficacy evaluations in phase III studies, if they are properly designed, implemented and analyzed, they should be successful from the efficacy point of view in most cases. Since power calculations are typically done to give an 80% to 90% probability of being successful, there will theoretically be a 10% to 20% chance that the study will fail by chance (because of bad luck), even though the product is effective. In reality, power calculations should be based on conservative assumptions so that the study’s real power is much greater than predicted; this assures that the studies will show efficacy in the large majority of cases. It is also possible to increase the chances of success of the entire phase III program by implementing three or more phase III studies in case one fails due to bad luck. If the failed study comes close to being successful, then it shouldn’t be an impediment to approval of the NDA. Negative studies are frequent for certain indications, e.g. depression, Alzheimer’s disease, so more than two phase III studies are often conducted in parallel for these indications.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "If properly designed and implemented, the major risk of phase III studies should be finding rare serious side-effects that generally could not be detected in smaller trials. Certain signs of rare toxicity can sometimes be inferred from small studies. However, sporadic severe toxicity can occur without this kind of warning. This kind of sporadic rare toxicity represents a risk that cannot be completely eliminated prior to completion of the phase III studies and breaking of the study codes.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "As described in the prior section, completion of the study reports required for the NDA can involve many steps. A delay of any step may delay completion of the study report. The delay of a single study report (the NDA will typically contain dozens) will usually delay the entire NDA submission. Therefore, is it very important to closely track the detailed status of each report to assure that they are all progressing as scheduled and that nothing is delaying progress along the planned critical path. An important part of managing the end of phase III is preserving confidentiality, so as to avoid the possibility of misuse of the phase III results for stock trading. Thus, documentation of steps taken to preserve confidentiality should be done very carefully, and all reasonable steps to encrypt confidential information should be used.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "A rule of thumb: Don’t investigate questions unless you can accept all the realistically possible answers. For example, do not undertake a study designed to show your drug is superior to a competitor unless you are very sure that the study will validate your hypothesis of superiority. Also, it is generally not a good idea to evaluate drug effects on endpoints that are not well accepted by the scientific community because even if the results of the study of such endpoints show the desired effect, they may be interpreted in a negative way by some members of the scientific community.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "All studies should be aimed at gathering data that will aid healthcare practitioners when they use the product. This may sometimes involve characterizing patient groups who should not receive the product because of undue risk; although this may initially reduce the market for the product, it will likely reduce the chances of serious problems during marketing, thus contributing to the long-term success of the product. I believe there are a number of approved products that ended up being removed from the market because they were used by inappropriate patient groups.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "At the time when these pressures are most extreme, employment opportunities for the development team also increase substantially. Developing a drug successfully is quite unusual, and the team members will be courted by companies that want to get their own drugs successfully developed.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Talented drug developers tend to replicate to repeat their success at their new companies, while the company losing the development team often has difficulty getting more NDA approvals. I believe this movement of talented personnel from one company to another is why the pharmaceutical industry will remain relatively fragmented, with no single company able to dominate success in the drug approval process.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "In the drug development business, getting the proper people is key to success, so this is perhaps management’s most important task. The best predictor of future performance is past performance. Be sure to hire people who have specific, hands-on experience successfully performing the tasks you will require of them. The pharmaceutical industry is filled with people who were on committees, have had only a peripheral connection to the drug that received approval during their tenure or have only very high level management experience with little experience handling the multitude of issues that are critical to successful drug development. If you can’t ask detailed questions, find someone who can to assist with the interview process. Be sure that the person assisting you will not be threatened by the hiring of other very capable people.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "any CRO contract should contain strong language protecting the sponsor from staff changes and from billing increases once a large project is started and it is hard to switch to a new contractor. It is also important to check references and reputations and to assure that the size of the project is adequate to keep the CRO motivated to do a good job. Specific, successful, recent experience in the therapeutic area of interest should be an important part of the evaluation of a CRO. In no case should strategic issues be decided by a CRO. They have an inherent conflict of interest and can often recommend studies that only they can do or that are unnecessary, in order to inflate their revenues.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "One of the quickest ways to learn about what it takes to get a new drug approved is to see what was successful for someone else. Fortunately, the FDA and the EMEA make some of their reviews of new products public. Most are available on their websites and often give details about the review process that are highly instructive for the drug development professional as well as for potential investors. Knowledge of what was required for prior products allows one to estimate what will be required for a new product enabling better planning, and more informed negotiations with regulatory bodies. Relevant approval documents should always be reviewed and thoroughly understood prior to embarking on any development program. They should also be carefully reviewed prior to meetings with regulators. This is because regulators are heavily influenced by precedents set by prior approvals and are understandably cautious about deviating from what was required in the past because of potential criticism for making arbitrary decisions, and because any deviation from past practices may set a new undesired precedent. Reviewing regulatory approval documents can also be very helpful to potential investors, since they provide a reality check against plans and claims made by companies about the regulatory hurdles they face.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "For a new chemical entity, a cost between $45 and $70 million dollars is typically adequate.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "The expense of getting a new product approved (up to $70 million) may be compared to the typical first year marketing budget for a new product, which is often in the range of $200 million. Thus, it is clear that much of the cost of a new drug is associated with promotion and marketing rather than the cost of studies required for approval.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "As mentioned previously, the cost of failed programs typically comprise the majority of research and development costs. Thus, the extreme importance of limiting the cost of programs that are destined to fail by devising strategies that identify them at an early stage. My team has been quite successful at this. We have never had a program fail in phase III because we always sought to design small, relatively inexpensive phase II studies that identified programs that were very likely to succeed, and more importantly, programs likely to fail.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "It is interesting to note that the cost of actually manufacturing most drug products is remarkably low, typically about $0.03 per tablet, including packaging and labeling. Thus, the cost of most prescription drugs reflect the costs of marketing, failed development and profit. The cost of successful development programs is minor by comparison. A typical new chemical entity development program should take no more than 5 or 6 years from the first study in humans to the new drug application (NDA). Companies that cannot adhere to this kind of schedule should be suspect. FDA review of a new chemical entity should take no more than 10 months. At the 10-month time-point, a complete response letter will typically be issued.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "The extra challenges involved in developing a truly novel agent often make it reasonable or even desirable to be the number-two product in development. The sponsor of the first product to reach the regulators will have to negotiate all the criteria for approval, size of safety database, etc. with the regulators; the company coming second will have a much clearer understanding of the requirements for approval, likely adverse events, etc. This often makes planning and implementing development much more efficient, so that the time between the approval of the first and second products may be much shorter than expected. My informal experience is that the second product to be approved often comes to dominate the market place. This was true for the H 2 antagonist anti-peptic ulcer drugs and for the drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease, among others. Being number two can also be the only viable strategy for a small company. If the company with the most advanced product is skillful at dealing with regulatory challenges, it will blaze the development trail in a way that a small company might find difficult or impossible.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Complications arise with respect to patent protection in the new country. Patents may be difficult to obtain since the utility of the product is public information in its original country, and therefore, not patentable. However, most countries offer “exclusivity,” which is the practical equivalent of patent protection, for products that are new molecular entities. The “exclusivity” can be substantial; for example, it is 5 and 10 years in the US and EU respectively.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "It is critical that the patent position of a product be as strong as possible. Projects should be reviewed by competent scientists and patent lawyers to be sure that adequate protection is available and that the product (including the active ingredients, excipients, and method of manufacture) does not infringe on patents owned by another company. This is a complex process, since there are many outstanding patents and the patents in every country where marketing is intended must be included in the patent evaluations. It is very important to be sure that patent lawyers have adequate support from key scientific staff. Often, patent issues involve subtle scientific issues that are beyond the technical expertise of any but the most specialized scientists.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Since patent coverage is so important to the commercial success of a product, it should be reviewed periodically during the development process to ensure that new information is added to the patent coverage as the development process proceeds and to ensure patent infringement has not become a problem due to the issuance of new patents.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "In the United States, generic names are assigned by the United States Adopted Names Council (USAN). Since every NDA must include the generic name of the product, it is wise to apply to USAN early, so that they have plenty of time to assign a name. Their decision making process can take months, especially if a product is the basis for a new class and will set a precedent for the naming of future products. USAN works closely with similar naming organizations in other countries so that generic names are generally the same in all countries.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Since a product cannot be approved without an approved trade name, the whole NDA approval can be delayed if the trade name is found to be unacceptable. Therefore, it is prudent to allocate plenty of time to selection of a proper trademark. All of the evaluations that will be done by the regulators during the NDA review process should be performed in advance by the company sponsor (e.g. evaluation for unacceptable implied claims, or confusion with other products). Since the outcome of the regulatory review of the proposed trademark cannot be predicted with certainty, it is wise to have one or two “backup” trademarks that can be rapidly substituted if regulators find the initial proposal unacceptable.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Every drug product marketed should have a unique appearance, to allow it to be identified even after it is removed from its packaging. It would be quite time-consuming to review the appearance of every marketed drug, so the best approach to fulfilling this requirement is to imprint a trademarked company logo on the drug product, along with a code that distinguishes the particular product.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "First, I have found that experienced, successful drug developers tend to repeat their performance again and again. Thus, if a company is using a development team that has been successful in the past, I believe it has a much higher chance of being successful in future development programs.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Interactions with regulatory bodies can also be an indicator of the chance of successful drug development. A company that regularly announces that its study designs are approved in advance by major regulatory bodies is much more likely to be successful over the long run than companies that elect to proceed with important studies without prior discussions with regulators. It is very important to remember that although all clinical studies are automatically reviewed by regulators during development, the automatic regulatory review focuses primarily on protecting patient safety. The adequacy of a particular protocol for its intended purpose will generally not be evaluated by regulators until the NDA review, unless a sponsor specifically requests such a review in advance of the time the study is implemented.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "It is common to use a very simple formulation for the initial drug product; often the active ingredient is mixed with simple excipients and placed in a gelatin capsule. Such formulations may not be suitable for commercial use, and therefore, the formulation will need to be changed as development continues. Using different formulations during development can result in difficulties justifying use of data obtained with an early formulation to support approval of the final formulation. It is important to be sure the development team is aware of this issue and has an effective plan to deal with it.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "It is important that the drug substance and product have adequate stability to make a practical product. A shelf-life of at least two years is usually required for a product to be commercially viable.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Mutagenicity - Seek information from the company and evaluate published data on mutagenicity of chemically-related compounds. Mutagenicity often predicts carcinogenicity, and for all but the most critical life-saving therapies, carcinogenicity is usually a complete obstacle to marketing approval.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Severe Toxicity - Toxicity which occurs suddenly as the dose is raised, occurs near clinically-useful doses, or that will be difficult to evaluate in people (e.g. microscopic tissue changes in organs that are not easily accessible for biopsy) is particularly troubling. The safety issues identified in animal studies have a strong influence on the safety evaluations required in the clinical program.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Each metabolite has the potential for both efficacy and toxicity. Metabolites that do not contribute to efficacy have only potential for toxicity. Therefore, products with multiple, non-efficacious, metabolites have a proportionately higher risk of toxicity.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "In many cases, a well-designed phase II study can be used as a pivotal study to support the efficacy of the product in the NDA. It is often a good idea to ask the company if the phase II data can be used for this purpose because it eliminates the need for one of the usually two required phase III studies. If the company states that the phase II results are acceptable as a pivotal proof of efficacy, ask if this has been verified by a major governmental regulatory authority. If so, this is a very promising sign.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "Companies often disclose the design and other details of their phase III studies in press releases or company presentations. This can allow a check of their power calculations as well as their projected time and costs. It is important that the company state that the design of phase III has been approved in advance by the FDA and other regulatory bodies.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "innovative study designs should be approached with great caution. It is often hard to get FDA to agree to a design it has not accepted before and when it does FDA tends to be skeptical of the results. Also, the failure of the study to show definitive efficacy was at least in part due to the difficultly of predicting the results due to its unusual design which had little or no precedent. Ultimately, tacrine and other Alzheimer’s drugs were approved based on more conventional study designs. A second lesson is clear. Always, always, always, get agreements with FDA in writing, and make sure that the written agreement is being interpreted in the same way by your company and FDA. Beware of the temptation to think you can force FDA to accept your interpretation of an ambiguous situation. FDA is required by law to interpret data conservatively, and in almost all cases, this is what they will do. Thus, clear written agreements, confirmed in writing on multiple occasions with the relevant division director are critical to successful relations with FDA especially when “innovative” development programs are undertaken. Simply put, don’t take unnecessary chances.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "When I probed the issue, I found that the conclusion that the market for Alzheimer’s disease therapies was small was based on market research that showed very small dollar volume for such products. However, what the market researchers failed to understand, was that the sales of Alzheimer’s products were small because there were no approved products on the market. It seemed logical to me that once a product was approved for treatment of Alzheimer’s, the market would be created, and this is exactly what happened. However, at the time, the idea that the market was small was remarkably common and widely accepted. I have since seen this same kind of problem in many other situations where market research must be adjusted for the likely impact of novel therapies in order to be accurate.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "An important strategy for assessing safety is to carefully consider the likely adverse consequences of a product’s desired clinical effects, and plan to monitor for them during the development process. For example, a drug designed to lower blood pressure could lower it too much in some patients, so it would be logical to monitor this carefully during development. In addition, since fainting, falling, dizziness, etc., can be a consequence of low blood pressure, these should be looked for as well as evidence of organ problems related to lowering of blood flow. In this particular example, some of the adverse events are relatively common, (e.g. dizziness) and can be expected to occur from time to time in healthy untreated people. Thus, they can be most easily detected if there is an untreated placebo-control group available for comparison. Use of such a control group is almost always a very good idea. However in some cases, it is unethical to use a placebo control group, for example when the illness being treated is serious and other approved treatments are available. In such cases, another active drug can be generally be used for comparison. The collection of safety information based on expected adverse events should be “built in” to the development program from the beginning and data monitored carefully at frequent intervals.\\n\\nSeptember 27, 2020", "successful drug development requires a complex mix of scientific and management abilities. In this section, I will try to briefly quantify the basic scientific skills needed to successfully manage development of a new chemical entity. The following list summarizes the technical skills required for a good team leader. 1. Basic inorganic and organic chemistry including stereochemistry 2.
